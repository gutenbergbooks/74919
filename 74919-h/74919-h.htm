<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
</h3>

<p>
"Good-Bye, my dear child.  You are quite
sure you will be all right and have everything
you want?  It's a straightforward run
now to Easthampton."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I shall be quite all right,
Mrs. Wade, and thank you very much for all the
trouble you've taken with me.  I'll sure never
forget it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wade nodded and waved as the train
moved out of the junction.  She had arrived
in London off an Australian boat only the day
before and had been in charge of the Australian
girl during the voyage over.  She had not
seen her native country for twenty-five years,
and so was naturally feeling rather excited.
She turned away with her conscience at rest,
having successfully fulfilled her obligation.  To
be sure, her charge was a very sensible and
practical girl, with a mind and will of her own,
and had given her no trouble.  Now she was
safely in the train that would carry her straight
to her destination, and Mrs. Wade could leave
off worrying about her, and turn her attention
to the relations she had not seen for twenty-five years.
</p>

<p>
Left "on her own" for the first time in her
life, Kitty Despard, Australian born and bred,
settled herself in her corner seat with an inward
feeling of mingled excitement and trepidation,
but outwardly with firmly set lips and resolute
air.  She was a stranger in a strange land, but
Australians are not noted for either nervousness
or backwardness.
</p>

<p>
Staring out at the flying green landscape
with unseeing eyes, she was wondering for the
hundredth time since her departure from home
what an English boarding-school would be like.
In the old-fashioned story-books they were the
most awful places; they had "crocodiles"
and "backboards" and lessons in
"deportment."  But schools had changed in later
years.  She knew that English girls, as a whole,
were fond of sports, and in that, at any rate,
she could hold her own, for she had been
brought up with half a dozen brothers and
sisters in a bush "township," where opportunities
for tennis and cricket were unlimited.
</p>

<p>
There was the question of lessons, of course.
Kitty had gone daily by the school train to
the High School in a neighbouring town.  She
had dodged as much work as she could, it is
true, but she had one strong point.  Jim and
Billy always declared that she was as good as
they were at mathematics.
</p>

<p>
No doubt there would be some "snobs"
at Easthampton, for Mrs. Wade's sister, who
had recommended the school to Kitty's father,
had said that all the scholars were the children
either of well-to-do or well-born families.  But
there were sure to be some good sorts,
too.
</p>

<p>
The train was a slow one, stopping at every
station.  One of these was apparently a
junction of a small kind, for there was quite
a little bustle as a crowd of passengers from
another train swarmed across the platform.
Kitty's carriage was invaded by five or six
girls who clambered noisily in with the happy
air of owning the whole train.  Kitty realized
with a start that they were evidently
Easthampton College girls, for they wore the same
scarlet hatband badge as she did.
</p>

<p>
"Van's further down," remarked one who
was craning her neck out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"We pick up Salome at the next station,"
added the tallest of the party.  "Oh, here
comes Paddy, late as usual, tearing down the
steps like mad.  She'll never do it."
</p>

<p>
The girl at the window had flung open the
door and was shouting, "Hi, hi, Paddy!" at
the top of her voice, and gesticulating
frantically.  As the train began to move, the
late-comer rushed up to the carriage door.  Half
a dozen helping hands seized hold of various
parts of her person and she was hauled in,
collapsing in a heap in the middle of the
carriage.  She picked herself up and subsided
panting into the seat next to Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Your usual method of catching trains,
Paddy!" remarked the tall girl.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  I did catch it, and that's
all that matters, sure," returned Paddy cheerfully.
"Cheer-oh, girls, how d'you like coming
back to the grindstone?  Never ye mind;
summer's before us, and cricket and tennis.
Oh, the merry, merry month of May!" she
began to sing in a tuneless voice.
</p>

<p>
"Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!" sang somebody else;
and there was a general chorus, "Oh don't,
Paddy!"
</p>

<p>
"Always optimistic.  You're very refreshing,
Paddy, my child," remarked the tall girl
when the hubbub had subsided.  "I came
down on the other line with Van, and she could
talk of nothing but matriculation."
</p>

<p>
"When every prospect pleases, and only
man is vile," sighed Paddy.  "Hallo!" as
her sharp eyes caught sight of Kitty's school
hat resting on the rack.  "Here's a new girl.
You <i>are</i> a new girl, aren't you?  I'm sure I've
never seen your face before."
</p>

<p>
Kitty replied in the affirmative, and the tall
girl broke in:
</p>

<p>
"Are you really?  I'm so sorry I didn't
notice it.  My name's Eileen Gilbert, and as I
happen to be a prefect it's very reprehensible
conduct on my part.  Do you come from far?"
</p>

<p>
"From Australia," replied Kitty.
</p>

<p>
There were exclamations from the listening
girls.
</p>

<p>
"Begorrah!" said Paddy.  "But there's a
way to come to school for you!  Have you
been in England long?"
</p>

<p>
"I only landed at Tilbury yesterday.  I
came over in charge of a friend of ours.  She
saw me safely in the train for Easthampton
and has promised dad she'll keep an eye on me
while I'm here."
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing," said Paddy sadly, "and won't
she be feeling the loss of it now!"
</p>

<p>
"The loss of what?"  Kitty's wits were
not quite so sharp at that moment as they
usually were.
</p>

<p>
"Her oie, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"Stop ragging, Paddy," interrupted Eileen.
Paddy, a girl with bright black eyes, a merry
face and untidy dark hair, merely laughed and
turned again to Kitty, who had already taken a
great fancy to her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe we've ever had an
Australian girl at Easthampton before.  How
old are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen&mdash;and a half."
</p>

<p>
"A little older than me.  I am only just
sixteen."
</p>

<p>
"Do tell us your name," interrupted one of
the smaller girls.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty Despard."
</p>

<p>
"Are you fond of sports?" asked Paddy
eagerly.  "I've heard all Australians are."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, very much," replied Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good!  What house are you in?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Carslake's."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Paddy's tone expressed volumes.
</p>

<p>
"That mouldy show!  What an impression
of Easthampton you'll get!  Now, it ought to
have been Sheerston's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Or Prince's," said Eileen quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Prince's isn't so bad, though it's not
up to Sheerston's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is.  It'll be top house this term,
you'll see."
</p>

<p>
"No, it won't.  But&mdash;Carslake's!  It's a
filthy hole."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" inquired Kitty,
feeling a little startled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's easily bottom house, and has
got a most awful reputation for slacking&mdash;which
it deserves."
</p>

<p>
Eileen nodded.  "Yes, and it used to be top
house once.  Now it's out of the running even
for third place.  Only two senior and a few
junior prizes went to it last year."
</p>

<p>
"And only one colour in the whole house,"
added Paddy.  "That's Duane, of course, for
hockey.  I should think she's safe to get her
tennis and cricket colours too, this term.  But
just think of it!  Only one in the whole house!
Slackers isn't the word for that lot.  Miss
Carslake sets the example and the girls follow
the sheep."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you heard the rumour that
Doreen was leaving?"
</p>

<p>
"Not really?  Won't it be funny if she
does!  What with Betty leaving suddenly at
the beginning of the year, and now Doreen&mdash;why,
there won't be one sixth-former left in
the house this term.  It's the queerest thing I ever
heard of.  What'll they do about a head prefect?"
</p>

<p>
"Here's the next stop," said Eileen.
</p>

<p>
"Look out for Salome.  We'll ask her if Doreen
really has left.  She's sure to know."
</p>

<p>
At the next station another addition was
made to the party, a tall girl with delightful
hair, dark and wavy and bobbed, an active-looking
figure and eyebrows that were noticeable
for their straightness.  A remarkable
girl&mdash;and she certainly had a remarkable name,
unless it was a nickname.  Paddy was obliging
enough to whisper to the new girl:
</p>

<p>
"That's Salome Hope, the head prefect of
my house, Sheerston's; frightfully clever at
lessons and a triple colour&mdash;hockey, cricket and
tennis.  There isn't a girl to touch her in the
school."
</p>

<p>
The whisper was a very audible one, like all
Paddy's whispers.  Salome heard it quite
plainly, and looked across at Kitty with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"One of the school celebrities, in fact.
Paddy is too, though she refrains from mentioning
it.  Are you a new girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Eileen.  "Kitty Despard,
from Australia.  They've put her into Carslake's.
Isn't it a shame!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Carslake's is in need of seniors, it
seems," said Salome.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true that Doreen has left?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, unfortunately.  It puts the house into
an unprecedented position, having to descend to
the Upper Fifth for a head prefect."
</p>

<p>
"Quite unprecedented.  Fortunately it'll
only be for a term.  But surely there are only
a few seniors of any sort in Carslake's now?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me see.  Margaret, Sonia and Bertha
in the Lower Fifth; Duane, Hilary and France
in the Upper&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity Hilary is so delicate, and of
course France would be hopeless as head
prefect.  I suppose it'll be Duane."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She's been chosen already."
</p>

<p>
"The best of the three," remarked Eileen,
"and rather clever in her way, I should think.
But a bit of a slacker, isn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm afraid so.  But she's got her
hockey colour.  That's always a help."
</p>

<p>
"Rather," put in Paddy.  "And I remember
her at tennis last year.  If she had bucked
up a bit she might have got her tennis colour
as well.  She could bat too, in cricket.  Only
she's so beastly erratic."
</p>

<p>
"That's it," agreed Salome, "you can't
depend on her.  She's a queer sort."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, Carslake's can't come down any
lower," said Eileen philosophically.  "That'll be
one comfort to her."
</p>

<p>
Then the conversation turned on other subjects,
and a few minutes later the train began
to draw up.
</p>

<p>
"Easthampton!" cried Paddy, who thought
she had been silent long enough.  "Tumble
out, everybody.  I'll look out for the school
truck.  All light luggage is here, being only
Easter vac.&mdash;except Kitty's, of course."
</p>

<p>
Eileen, as a prefect, took the new girl under
her wing.
</p>

<p>
"Run down to the luggage van and have
your trunks brought up here.  Then they can
go up to the school with ours.  There's plenty
of time.  Paddy will be some while fetching
Orpheus along with the truck; he always
crawls about like a snail."
</p>

<p>
As Kitty obediently went off down the platform
with her long strides, many of the girls
turned round to stare after her as she passed,
for she was far from being an insignificant girl.
She was tall, long-legged, and at a rather bony
and angular stage of growth.  Her face was
very tanned after the sea voyage and, like the
majority of Australian girls, her complexion was
nothing to boast about; she had cropped,
bright brown hair and alert grey-blue eyes;
there was something in her carriage and the
active swing of her walk that betrayed an
outdoor life with plenty of exercise.
</p>

<p>
"This is yours, miss," said the porter obligingly.
"For the school, miss?  Here's another
one for the school.  Take them both up the
platform, Tom."
</p>

<p>
The second trunk, as Kitty noticed with a
quick observant glance, was very smart and
expensive looking; and painted in white very
conspicuously across the top, in great contrast
to Kitty's humble initials, were these words:
"The Hon. Duane l'Estrange Estevan."
</p>

<p>
Kitty was immensely tickled.
</p>

<p>
"My gracious!" she said to herself.  "What
a name!  If it were mine I should want to
drown it.  An Honourable, too.  I sort of
think, if I run across her, I shan't hit it off
with the Hon. Duane l'Estrange Estevan.  That
is to say, if she's anything like her trunk, or
her name."
</p>

<p>
Australians are far less tolerant in their
criticisms than the English, and Kitty was
no exception, you see.
</p>

<p>
Returning to Eileen and her party, she
found that a little shambling man was loading
a truck with the girls' hand luggage.
</p>

<p>
"Come along now," said Paddy.  "We can
leave these things to Orpheus.  We call him
Orpheus," she explained to Kitty, "because he
blows the chapel organ.  He's got an
undeveloped cerebrum, you know, poor chap."
</p>

<p>
"Please, Paddy," remonstrated Salome.
"We're not in school yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, dippy on the dome then, if that's
more suited to your intelligence," retorted Paddy
recklessly.
</p>

<p>
They set off from the station, Salome and
Eileen leading the way, Paddy and Kitty
following, and the younger ones trailing along
behind.  They passed through the small town
of Easthampton and after half a mile's walk
they arrived at Easthampton College.  Kitty's
first glimpse of that famous school was an
imposing pair of iron gates with a view beyond
of trim shrubberies and lawns, a curving drive,
a pleasant red-bricked house, and a background
of green fields.  The gates were open.
</p>

<p>
"Easthampton is quite a little colony of
itself," said Salome, turning to Kitty with a
smile.  "There are nearly three hundred girls
in the school, quite two hundred being yearly
boarders."
</p>

<p>
"How many houses are there?"
</p>

<p>
"Four.  This is Sheerston's near the gate,
my house and the biggest.  Carslake's is a
little farther on down the drive.  Prince's
and Green's are the other side of the
quadrangle, side by side.  The school building is
at the back of the quad, and beyond are the
playing-fields and the kitchen garden.  We
have two big fields.  We call them Big Side
and Little Side, because one is used by the
seniors and one by the juniors.  The
swimming-bath and gym are in the playing-fields."
</p>

<p>
"Will you take Kitty along to Carslake's,
Salome?" asked Eileen.  "No Carslake's
prefects came down in our train."
</p>

<p>
"Right-oh," replied Salome.  "It's not so
far for me.  Come along, Kitty."
</p>

<p>
They went off down the drive, past Sheerston's,
till they came to a somewhat smaller
though similarly built building.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I'll hunt you out a senior and leave
you in her charge," said Salome.  "Your
luggage will arrive presently and will be put
in the vestibule.  Then you unpack and carry
your things up to your dormitory.  Hi," seizing
hold of a small girl who was in the vestibule
unpacking; "run up to the dormitories and
unearth a senior of some sort.  Isn't your
head prefect knocking around somewhere?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she's come yet," replied
the child.
</p>

<p>
"Then she ought to have," said Salome,
"to look after her troublesome young charges.
Never mind.  Anybody will do."
</p>

<p>
The girl disappeared, returning in a few
minutes with the desired senior.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Salome!" the new-comer exclaimed.
"What brings you in this direction so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"A new girl.  Kitty Despard, all the way
from Australia.  Kitty, this is Hilary, one of
your seniors," and after exchanging a few more
words Salome departed.
</p>

<p>
Kitty's new acquaintance was a rather
small, slight girl with soft, fair hair, pale,
irregular features and dark, hazel eyes.  Her
manner, as she showed Kitty her cubicle and
told her where to put her things, was courteous
and considerate, but quiet and self-contained.
Kitty had hardly finished unpacking before a
bell rang and they went down to tea in a big,
cheery room, containing four or five long tables.
The new girl was rather dazed by the chatter
and laughter and crowd of new faces.  She
gathered little save that most of the girls were
smaller than herself, but that there was either
a mistress or a senior girl at the head and foot
of each table.  She herself sat next to Hilary,
who presided at the foot of one of them.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the evening seemed still more
dreamlike.  There was a brief interview with
the house mistress, Miss Carslake, who
welcomed her kindly, shook hands rather limply,
asked her a number of questions in a pleasant
voice, and gave her hints on what she might
expect to find in her new life.
</p>

<p>
At eight o'clock another bell rang, and she was
astonished when somebody remarked, "Chapel."  She
thought vaguely of Wesleyans and Baptists,
and looked to see what the others were doing.
Everybody made for the vestibule and
donned hats and wrappers of some sort.
Hilary considerately took Kitty in charge again.
</p>

<p>
"Get your hat.  It's chapel.  We only have
morning chapel usually&mdash;just a short service&mdash;but
we always have evening chapel the first
and last night of term."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the quad with the others to
the pretty little chapel that adjoined the school
building, meeting converging streams of girls
from the other houses.  Kitty, as if in a dream,
knelt, rose, and sat with the rest of the two
hundred and fifty girls, but there was
something strangely impressive in the hearty
chanting of the solitary psalm, "I will lift up mine
eyes unto the hills ... the Lord shall
preserve thy going out, and thy coming in," and
the still heartier rendering of the hymn:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lord receive us with Thy blessing,<br>
  Once again assembled here.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Kitty was sitting near the organ and could
not help noticing the player, evidently one of
the girls, for her bright chestnut hair hung in
a heavy mass down her back.  Kitty was so
absorbed in examining her aristocratic profile
and admiring the elegant way in which she
wore her clothes, that she missed a considerable
part of the lesson.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards came supper, an informal meal
of hot cocoa and "pavement" (a slice of cake),
then bed bell and lights out, for the seniors,
at ten o'clock.  In spite of the strangeness of
being enclosed in the white-panelled walls of
a daintily furnished cubicle, Kitty was so tired
and drowsy that before long her eyelids closed
and she was sound asleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE SENIORS OF CARSLAKE's
</h3>

<p>
With the clang of the everlasting bell in
her ears Kitty awoke, wondering for a
few minutes where she could be, and almost
thinking she was back in her little bunk on
board the <i>Wallaroon</i>.
</p>

<p>
Then she heard a yawn, and a sleepy voice,
"Oh, bother!  Was that rising bell?" and
Hilary's voice in answer, "Yes, Peggy my
child, it was.  What's more, I can see it
raining out of my window."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, blow!" said another voice.  "Shan't
get up then.  Wake me by twenty to eight,
somebody, please, if I fall asleep again."
</p>

<p>
"Get up, you lazy kids," said Hilary
sternly.  "It's disgraceful, the way you lie
in bed when you might have a run round the
field before breakfast or a turn in the gym.
No wonder we never get represented in gym
displays.  You know it's the rule to turn out
when rising bell goes."
</p>

<p>
"Bother the bell!" said the voice of Peggy.
"And you can't make us, Hilary.  Duane is
head of this dormitory, not you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you ought to have a mistress sleeping
next door, like the other dormitories.  You'd
have to alter your ways a little then.  Are
you awake, Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"I should hope so," replied Kitty promptly.
"I couldn't very well stay asleep with all this
talking going on."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, there are plenty who do.  Are
you getting up?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Kitty, jumping out of
bed with a spring.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  I'll take you along to the gym
for a look-round before breakfast.  Be ready
by a quarter to eight, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"All right," answered Kitty at once.
"Where do I get water from?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, one of the juniors will get you hot
water from the bathroom, if you put your
jug outside your cubicle."
</p>

<p>
Kitty was quite ready when Hilary knocked
for admittance.  By that time, the rest of the
dormitory, from the noise they were making,
had evidently turned out.
</p>

<p>
"Half a tick," said Hilary.  "I must
perform my usual morning's task."  She raised
her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Duane, are you awake?"
</p>

<p>
A sleepy voice made reply:
</p>

<p>
"No.  'Tisn't time to get up yet."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is," replied Hilary firmly.  "Hurry
up and turn out."
</p>

<p>
"What's the time?" said the same drawling voice.
</p>

<p>
"A quarter to eight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, I can just do it in ten minutes.
Call me at ten to."
</p>

<p>
"I'm just going.  You'll be late one of
these days.  You know last term you were
hardly ever properly dressed for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I'll count three and jump out on the
'three.'"
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up then."
</p>

<p>
"One&mdash;&mdash;" began the speaker with the tired
voice, and paused.
</p>

<p>
"Two&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A still longer pause.
</p>

<p>
"Two and a half."
</p>

<p>
Another pause, then:
</p>

<p>
"Two and three quarters."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on," said Hilary.  "Two and seven
eighths!  I'm going now, anyway," and
patience evidently not being her strong point,
she walked out of the dormitory, throwing a
"Come along, Kitty," over her shoulder as
she did so.
</p>

<p>
Now Kitty's cubicle was next to the one
belonging to the tired individual.  She had
been listening to the conversation with a
feeling of mingled pity and contempt, for slacking
of any sort made no appeal whatever to the
vigorous, active Australian girl.  As Hilary
walked out, Kitty's glance fell on her wet
sponge, lying on the washstand.  Catching it
up, she sprang lightly on to the edge of the
bed, caught hold of the top of the partition,
and judging the whereabouts of the invisible
speaker's face by careful guesswork, squirted
the contents of the sponge over the partition.
Apparently the shower of water found its mark,
for there was the sound of a gasp and a violent
creak of the bed.  Kitty, judging discretion to
be the better part of valour, hastily dropped
the sponge and slipped swiftly out of the
dormitory, catching Hilary up in the passage
outside.
</p>

<p>
The two walked on together.
</p>

<p>
"Who's the girl you called Duane?"
inquired Kitty, wondering why the unusual
name sounded familiar, till, the next instant,
she remembered the trunk at the station and
its flaunting lettering.  Wouldn't the boys at
home laugh when she told them in her letter
that one of her first acts in England was to
squirt water over a member of the British aristocracy!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll soon get to know who Duane
is," replied Hilary.  "She's just been appointed
head prefect of our house.  She's in my form,
the Upper Fifth."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Kitty, remembering the
conversation in the train between Eileen and
Salome.  So this was the girl they had been
discussing so freely!  Somehow or other,
though she had not seen her yet, Kitty was quite
sure she was not going to like her head prefect.
</p>

<p>
When breakfast was over, Miss Carslake
announced that the Principal wanted to see
all the school prefects in her room that morning.
"She also wishes to see all the senior
girls of the house," the mistress added; "so
those who are not prefects must also be ready
after chapel."
</p>

<p>
Of course there was a certain amount of
excitement at this unusual proceeding, and
many reasons were suggested for it.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I have to go?" inquired Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  Come along.  You're sure to
be in the Upper or Lower Fifth, so you must
look upon yourself as a senior."
</p>

<p>
Consequently, about ten o'clock, Kitty found
herself with the six other senior girls of
her house in the sanctum of Miss St. Leger,
Principal of Easthampton College.  She was
very popular with her girls, who were wont
to declare that they could not imagine
Easthampton without her.
</p>

<p>
The seniors sat gravely on chairs in a little
semicircle.  Kitty, through hearing them
address one another, had already learned their
names, and surveyed them interestedly, for
these were to be her future companions.  There
was, first of all, the slight, fair Hilary,
insignificant in appearance but ready of tongue
and decidedly shrewd of brain.  Then there
were the Lower Fifth-formers sitting side by
side.  Margaret Batt was liked by everybody;
she was a nice, simple, unaffected English girl,
not brilliant in any way, but always ready to
lend a helping hand to anyone who needed
it.  Sonia Edwards was a pretty, golden-haired,
smartly dressed girl, inclined to be vain and
rather empty-headed, though not ill-natured.
Kitty rather sweepingly described her to
herself as a "fluffy-haired, dressed-up
doll."  Bertha Salter was not very prepossessing in
appearance.  She had straight, carroty hair,
a sturdy but stockily-built figure, and a rather
heavy, sullen expression.  Kitty fancied she
looked rather sly, then quickly reproved
herself for an unkind thought about a total
stranger.  The girl was very likely quite a
decent sort.  She couldn't help her looks.
</p>

<p>
There remained the other two Upper Fifth-formers.
The second of the three prefects was
the chestnut-haired girl who played the organ
for chapel services.  She was not exactly pretty,
but there was something distinctive about her
carriage and dress.  Later, Kitty discovered
that Francesca Kent had a natural taste for
art, and was firmly and proudly convinced
that she had what she called an "artistic
temperament," though in reality she had the
sweetest of tempers.  She was quite a character
in the school.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, was the Hon. Duane
l'Estrange Estevan.  Kitty decided that there
was nothing insignificant about her looks, at
least.  She was as tall and long-limbed as
Kitty herself, but there the resemblance stopped.
She was rather broader of shoulder, and there
was nothing awkward or angular about her.
Her hair was black and thick and cut in a
straight mediæval bob; her complexion was
inclined to be sallow; her eyes were very grey
and formed a curious contrast to her black hair
and eyebrows, looking remarkably vivid and
luminous in their dark setting.  She lounged,
rather than sat, in her chair and listened with
a blasé, preoccupied indifference to what the
revered Principal was saying.  Duane's voice
was curiously soft, with a decided drawl in it;
her movements, too, were listless and deliberate.
She was an English aristocrat from head to
foot, Kitty told herself, and Kitty had all a
self-respecting Australian's contempt for the
English aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
Now the Principal was speaking to them, and
Kitty's whole attention was fixed on her words.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted specially to say just a few words
to the older girls in Miss Carslake's House.  I
expect you can guess what I want to say.  To
put it frankly, girls, I don't like to see one of
the houses so hopelessly below all the others in
both school work and sports."
</p>

<p>
"Well, somebody must be bottom, Miss
St. Leger," remarked Frances Kent brightly.
Francesca loudly and frequently proclaimed that
she was not really interested in anything except
art.
</p>

<p>
"True, Frances," replied Miss St. Leger,
"but not always&mdash;nor in everything&mdash;nor so
easily."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but surely, Miss St. Leger," protested
Duane in her tired voice, "it is not so bad as that."
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger smiled.  "Perhaps I was
exaggerating a little, for your own good.  I
want to see you girls rouse yourselves, and
make up your minds that your house isn't going
to take bottom place in everything.  Let us
look at a few facts fairly.  Last year this house
only carried off two prizes among the seniors,
Frances first in drawing, and Hilary second
in English.  Neither did your juniors earn the
number they could have done.  You have
plenty of intelligent juniors, if they would only
make up their minds to try.
</p>

<p>
"Now look at sports.  You are going to be
bottom this year if you don't make a big effort
this term.  Are you going to win any cricket
or tennis matches, or any of the events on
Sports Day?  As you are a long way behind
the others at present, you will have to make a
big effort to catch up."
</p>

<p>
"We are handicapped, Miss St. Leger,"
said Duane.  "We are so few numerically."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know your house is smaller than
Sheerston's or Prince's, but no smaller than
Miss Green's, and they are making quite a
plucky fight for scholastic honours and the
House Sports Shield."
</p>

<p>
"I did not quite mean the number of girls
in the house, Miss St. Leger," the head prefect
defended herself.  "I was referring to the
number of seniors.  After all, it is the seniors
who form the backbone of the house teams.
There are only seven of us; Sheerston's, for
example, have over twenty."
</p>

<p>
"True again.  Of course you have been
unfortunate in losing three senior girls in the
middle of the school year&mdash;a most unusual
occurrence.  That is why I put the only new
senior girl this term in your house.  But it is
quality, as well as quantity, that counts."  She
looked at the listening girls, and a smile
flashed over her face, smoothing out its lines
and wrinkles.  "You were studying Henry V
last term in the Upper Fifth, weren't you,
girls?  Accept his point of view, then&mdash;the
fewer fighters, the greater share of glory," and
with a few more parting words of encouragement,
she dismissed them.
</p>

<p>
Kitty found the rest of that day one whirl
of "settling down."  First of all, with half a
dozen other new girls, all younger, she was put
through a searching oral examination by Miss
Sheerston, in order to be "placed."  Kitty,
whose nerves hindered her, acquitted herself
more creditably than she had hoped.
</p>

<p>
Miss Sheerston was a queer, masculine-looking
person, with a shirt blouse, high collar, and
grey hair strained back from her face, but her
manner was brisk, kindly, and invigorating in
the extreme; her own girls thought the world
of their house mistress.  She praised Kitty's
mathematics, declared her French to be
appalling, and finally said, "You are sixteen, you
say.  Well, I don't see why you shouldn't
make a shot for removal into the Sixth Form
next term.  Only you would have to give up
any idea of taking extra classes, for the present,
and devote extra time to your French."
</p>

<p>
Kitty, feeling that she would have quite
enough to cope with in the Upper Fifth, and
then in the Sixth, as it was, hastily disclaimed
any desire to take special classes, and so it was
settled that she should join the ranks of the
most elevated members of her own house in
the Upper Fifth.
</p>

<p>
In her few leisure moments she was busily
arranging her part of the study she was to share
with Hilary.  All Sixth-formers were entitled to
studies, of which they were very proud, sharing
one between two.  As there were now no
Sixth-formers at Carslake's, the four studies were
handed over to the Fifths, Upper and Lower.
</p>

<p>
Kitty rather wished she had been put in one
of the other houses, not because Carslake's was
the bottom house and bore rather a poor
reputation, but because she was not particularly
drawn to any one of her companions there.
They were nice girls in their way, but there
was not one of them whose tastes were
sufficiently in common with Kitty's to make her
desirable as a special chum.  Hilary was quiet
and reserved; besides, she was not allowed to
play games, and half Kitty's enjoyment and
interest in life came from games and outdoor
exercises.  Frances Kent was a being from
another world altogether.  So was the head
prefect; her queer personality made no appeal
to Kitty, who liked people who said what they
meant and called a spade a spade and not a
garden implement.
</p>

<p>
"If only jolly Paddy or that clever-looking
Salome girl had been in this house," she thought,
regretfully, "they would have made things hum
between them.  But these are evidently a hopeless lot."
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the second day, Hilary
came into the study with the announcement,
"All seniors to be in Cato's study at
three-thirty to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Afternoon lessons finished at three-fifteen,
and from then till tea-time, at five, everybody
was free to play games, go for a walk, or, if it
were very wet, amuse themselves indoors.
</p>

<p>
"Who's Cato?" inquired Kitty, looking puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Cato?  Why, the Hon. Duane of course.
Nearly everyone gets a nickname of some sort.
The meeting is to talk over Prinny's little
welcoming lecture."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see much good in talking," retorted
Kitty.  "It's doing that matters."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as far as sports are concerned, I
don't see there's much we can do.  Duane is
the only one who is much good at them.  I'm
forced to be a looker-on, worse luck.  Somebody
wants to explode a bomb-shell in our midst and
wake everybody up."
</p>

<p>
The seven seniors duly met.  Hilary and
Kitty were the first arrivals.  They found Duane
sprawling in the easy-chair with a book in her
lap, and Frances, enveloped in an overall of
bird-of-paradise hue, busily dabbing at a large
sheet of paper mounted on an easel.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, come in," called out the head
prefect, in her soft drawl.  "I know France is
taking up all the room with her horrible mess,
but you'll just have to sit down where you
can&mdash;so long as you don't sit down on tubes of
paint.  You see what I have to put up with
every day!  Lumps of putty&mdash;I mean
clay&mdash;everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Don't rot, Duane," said France.  "Art's a
serious matter.  There's nothing funny about
it, as some people seem to think."
</p>

<p>
"'Tisn't the art that's funny, my dear,"
returned Duane.  "It's the artist."
</p>

<p>
"'But what is it supposed to be?" inquired
Hilary, surveying the artist's work with
puzzled face.
</p>

<p>
The others, who had now all arrived,
proffered various suggestions.
</p>

<p>
"A storm at sea," said Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"A futurist&mdash;or is it a cubist?&mdash;portrait of
a lady," suggested Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I've got it!" exclaimed Hilary.
"One of those puzzle thingummies.  Little
Red Riding Hood walking through the wood.
Find the wolf."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk rot," said the artist again.
"You know it isn't any of those things."
</p>

<p>
"But seriously, France," argued Hilary,
"it's like nothing on earth that I've seen,
anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it isn't," said France, impatiently.
"You see, it's upside-down.  It's a new idea;
to paint a picture upside-down so that you
can visualize upside-down.  Don't you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, who on earth wants to visualize
upside-down?"
</p>

<p>
"Turn it up," said Duane, "so that we can
see what it's meant to be."
</p>

<p>
France did so.  They all gazed at it in
silence, till at last Margaret said hesitatingly:
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;don't you think you've got it a
bit mixed up, France, and the&mdash;the other way
was the right way up after all?  That looked
more as if it might be something than&mdash;than
this does."
</p>

<p>
The artist's face was a study of mingled
feelings.  Everybody burst into a roar of
laughter, so that in the noise nobody heard
the sound of a knock, or became aware of
Paddy's entry until they heard her voice behind
them.
</p>

<p>
"I say, is this France's upside-down picture?
Why couldn't you stand on your heads
and look at it, instead of turning it round?
'Twould seem more worth-while painting it,
if you did that."
</p>

<p>
Kitty could no longer hold herself modestly
in the background, as became a new girl.
</p>

<p>
"Let's try," she cried excitedly, and
proceeded to balance herself on her hands, feet
in the air.  Of course, Paddy tried to follow
her example, till the indignant artist tumbled
her over with a sounding thump.  When the
confusion had somewhat subsided Duane wanted
to know what Paddy was doing "trespassing
on hallowed ground."
</p>

<p>
"How unkind it is of you, Duane," said
Paddy, reproachfully, "when I'm saving you
a little journey.  Salome's sent over a copy of the
rules you head prefects drew up at the meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Same old rules, I suppose?" inquired Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," said Duane, carelessly.  "They're
practically unaltered, needless to say."
</p>

<p>
"Still," put in Paddy, "as you've a new
girl here, I'd better read them out for her
benefit."
</p>

<p>
"You can if you like," returned Duane,
indifferently, but with a faint smile twitching
the corner of her mouth.  She knew Paddy
of old.
</p>

<p>
So Paddy picked up the paper, cleared her
throat and began:
</p>

<p>
"No. 1.&mdash;No junior is allowed blacking on
her boots more than once a month.
</p>

<p>
"No. 2.&mdash;Juniors must wash at least once
a day.
</p>

<p>
"No. 3.&mdash;Only members of house elevens
allowed to wear carpet slippers at hockey.
</p>

<p>
"No. 4.&mdash;Juniors must shut their eyes
properly at grace, but seniors can keep theirs
open to see the juniors don't.
</p>

<p>
"No. 5.&mdash;Only members of the school first
elevens allowed to wear their sports blazers
unbuttoned.
</p>

<p>
"No. 6.&mdash;Only girls with gym colours
allowed to slide down the banisters.
</p>

<p>
"No. 7.&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here, stow it," interrupted Hilary, laughing.
"I should think Kitty is of the opinion
that that's enough for one go."
</p>

<p>
"Quite enough to convince me that Paddy
has a very fertile imagination," retorted Kitty,
promptly.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said Paddy, with a sigh.  "I was
afraid my efforts would be wasted on you.
You've lived long enough in the world to know
a little too much.  Never mind," brightening
up, "we've a couple of new juniors in our
house, quite youngsters; I really think it's
my duty to instruct them in the rules of the
school.  So I will, as sure as eggs is meat,"
and she departed, chuckling.
</p>

<p>
"What about our meeting?" said Duane,
when Paddy had disappeared.  "Seems to me
we've got a pretty big job on, if we take on
all Prinny's little hints."
</p>

<p>
"Too late to do much this year," said
France.  "If I take my first in art again, I
shall be quite satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"What about you others?" said Hilary,
slowly.  "Let's see what we can muster up
in the way of prizes."
</p>

<p>
"Precious little, I bet," returned Duane.
"I'm in the running for second prize in science,
but Salome will take the first.  I can't beat
her."
</p>

<p>
"And of course I'm in the running for an
English prize again," remarked Hilary.  "But
one can never be certain."
</p>

<p>
Margaret declared she would try for a
history prize and Bertha for an arithmetic
prize, but neither really thought much of their
chances of success.
</p>

<p>
"Lively, isn't it?" said Hilary, reflectively.
"We shall have to stir up our juniors a bit
if we want anything done."
</p>

<p>
"They're too busy squabbling amongst
themselves," said Duane.  "You know they
have two rival societies on the go.  The
Budmushes and the something else&mdash;I forget what."
</p>

<p>
"The P. Squareds, whatever that may
mean.  Sounds like an algebraic formula.
Can't we put an end to it and get them to join forces?"
</p>

<p>
"Put an end to their blessed societies, you
mean?" said Duane.  "They wouldn't hear
of it.  They're free to have as many secret
societies as they like, so long as they don't
break rules.  By the by, there'll be our usual
inter-house cricket and tennis matches this
term.  I shall soon have to see about drawing
up our teams."
</p>

<p>
Another silence.  The head prefect appeared
on the point of dropping off to sleep, and as
nobody seemed to have anything to offer in
the way of suggestions or ideas, the girls made
their departure in ones and twos.  Kitty
thought it had been a very feeble, ineffectual
affair altogether.  After the invigorating
atmosphere brought into the room for a few
minutes by Paddy, it had seemed very flat
and lifeless.  Hilary alone had made some
attempt to get a definite plan fixed, and she
had not succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Kitty hated the idea of belonging to such
a slack house.  Couldn't she do something
herself?  She knew she was a good tennis and
cricket player, and later on she would play
for all she was worth.  But the playing of one
girl wouldn't make such a great deal of
difference unless well supported.  As the week
slipped by she turned things over in her mind,
until suddenly an idea flashed into it.  Of
course, they would think it frightful conceit
on her part, but she didn't care about that.
At least, it would give Carslake's the shock
that was necessary to wake up the house from
its lethargy....
</p>

<p>
By the end of the first school week, Kitty
was beginning to feel at home.  She and Hilary
were invariably the first to turn out in the
mornings, while the head prefect was equally
certain to be the last.  Kitty never attempted
to repeat her venture of the first morning,
leaving it to Hilary to arouse her lackadaisical
head prefect.  She wondered at first if Duane
were aware of the identity of the perpetrator
of the outrage, but was not certain until one
dinner-time half-way through the week.  Dinner
that day began with soup.  In passing a plateful
to the next girl, Kitty's arm was accidentally
jolted, the plate tipped up, and a liberal half
of its contents poured over the cloth and into
the lap of her unfortunate neighbour.  The
girl gave a loud exclamation, which drew
everybody's attention to Kitty's table, and there
was a hush in the buzz of talk.  In the silence,
the voice of the head prefect, with its
unmistakable drawl, was heard all over the room.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right.  Merely a little accident
with the soup.  Our friend Kitty is evidently
of the opinion that shower-baths are good for
people.  In fact, it has become quite a generous
habit of hers to treat people to them gratis!"
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh, especially from
the girls of Dormitory A who remembered the
previous incident.  Kitty, blushing somewhat
at finding the public amused at her expense,
laughed also, to cover up her confusion, and
mopped up the mess with her serviette.  So
Duane did know who it was!  Well, she
certainly didn't blame her for getting her own
back when the opportunity occurred.
</p>

<p>
On Monday morning Hilary cheered up the
dormitory with the information that for once
it was not raining.  There were more cheerful
faces that day than there had been all the week.
When morning school was over, as the girls
were idling around waiting for the dinner bell
to go, Carslake's, on looking at its notice-board,
received quite a shock.  There, boldly written
for all and sundry to see, was a notice to the
effect that Kitty Despard, as an Australian girl
who had just come from the Dominion,
challenged any English girl in the house who
cared to accept, to a singles tennis match.
</p>

<p>
All through the dinner-hour the house,
juniors and seniors alike, could think of nothing
but this audacious move on the part of a new
girl.  The news spread rapidly to the girls in
the other houses, and they were not slow to
offer their criticisms when they all met at
afternoon lessons.  The Upper Fifth were really
moved for once.  A few gazed upon Kitty
coldly; a few, who belonged to the other
houses, treated it as a huge joke; the majority
looked somewhat askance at the challenger.
Of course, it was pure, unadulterated cheek on
her part, but it required a good deal of nerve,
and they rather admired her for possessing so
much As soon as the interval came, Paddy
agilely clambered over half a dozen desks to
Kitty's side.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, kid!  You've started well,
say with a regular flourish of trumpets.  I do
admire your nerve though.  Carslake's wants
shaking up a bit."
</p>

<p>
"That's why I've done it," Kitty confided
upon a sudden impulse, for here was a kindred
spirit.  "But don't tell anybody.  They think
it's just showing off on my part."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, they'll forget all about that
you put up a good enough game to win your
match," said Paddy consolingly.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile others were attacking the Carslake
girls.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Duane, I suppose somebody will
accept the challenge, or else it will look as
though you've nobody good enough."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to do it yourself, Cato.
There's nobody else who can play decently
in your house, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"There's Francie.  Now then, France, show
what you're made of.  You could stand on your
head and serve, you know, and receive upside-down."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to have a try, anyway," retorted
France, with spirit.  She was quite indignant at
this conceit on the part of the new girl, and
would not admit that in her inmost soul she
rather admired her for it.  But if Kitty hoped
to move the head prefect, she was doomed to
disappointment.  That worthy was as imperturbable
as ever, blinked lazily once or twice,
then murmured, "Oh, I don't mind having a
friendly game with her if she wants one.  I
dare say it will be quite a good match."
</p>

<p>
"We'll all be there to see the fun if it does
come off," Paddy promised.
</p>

<p>
The sun continued to shine; a spell of fine
spring weather had evidently set in, and by the
following Wednesday summer sports had begun
at Easthampton.
</p>

<p>
The first event in which everybody was
interested was the playing of the challenge
games between the new Australian girl and her
own house.  Carslake's decided that France and
Duane, their two best tennis players, were
sufficient to uphold the dignity of the house,
and told themselves with satisfaction that if
Kitty could beat them upon their own courts,
she would indeed be a welcome acquisition to
their ranks.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a crowd to see the first
game, between Kitty and Frances.  By mutual
consent it had been agreed that both matches
should consist of twelve games, unless there
was a tie, when a decider should be played.
Vanda West, head prefect of Prince's, and the
school tennis captain, was umpiring.
</p>

<p>
The result was a foregone conclusion after
the first two games.  France played with
elegance and style, and showed an astonishing
fleetness of foot, but her strokes lacked force.
She put up a gallant fight to the end, but she
was helpless against Kitty's lightning movements,
smashing strokes and accurate placing.
She only succeeded in winning one game out of
twelve, a fact which did not seem to trouble
her in the least, for she smiled happily as she
congratulated the winner, then hurried off to
her organ practice.
</p>

<p>
The next day, Vanda, as she joined the
waiting group by the court, said to Kitty, half
jokingly, half earnestly:
</p>

<p>
"Play up, my child.  I've got one or two
empty places to fill in the school tennis eight,
and Carslake's will have to supply me with
somebody to fill one of them.  You've a chance
to get your tennis colour, like everyone else,
you know."
</p>

<p>
Kitty's second match was a far harder
struggle.  Duane, who was a picture of elegance
in her short white tennis frock and scarlet
"colour," played with considerable skill, some
of her strokes being extremely powerful,
particularly her service.  The spectators were kept
interested, for Kitty's game&mdash;especially her
volleying&mdash;was really spectacular.  In spite of
her ability to retrieve nearly everything Duane
sent over the net, the first six games were
ding-dong ones, each player winning her
service.  Duane, not so quick and dashing as
Kitty, at first held her own, returning Kitty's
deliveries by good anticipation and a wonderful
reach.  Then Kitty seemed to be playing on
the very top of her form and gradually drew
ahead.  In the end her amazing vigour and
lightning quickness gained the upper hand,
and she finished the victor by seven games to
five.
</p>

<p>
"Well played, Kitty," said Vanda appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
Duane donned her blazer and sauntered
across to the winner.  Kitty was hot and
panting and flushed; Duane showed no signs of
exertion, save that she was breathing more
deeply than usual.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p44"></a>
"Good game, Kitty, wasn't it!" she said,
in her emotionless way.  "You're a fine player.
Can't think how you can fly about the court
at the rate you do, though."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I like plenty of exercise," returned
Kitty, feeling a little shy and embarrassed at
the congratulations showered upon her from
all sides.  She made her escape from the field
as quickly as possible, while the spectators
gradually drifted back to their own quarters,
still discussing the match and the outstanding
points of the play.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE P. SQUAREDS
</h3>

<p>
Kitty rolled over in bed and opened her
eyes with a start.  What was that?  She
was sure she had heard someone moving
stealthily down the dormitory.  The next
instant she heard the sound of a smothered
giggle and drew a breath of relief.  Of course
it was only those harum-scarum juniors up to
some prank; and by the scuffling noise, thought
Kitty, nearly the whole of the dormitory seemed
astir.
</p>

<p>
Just as the sounds diminished Kitty heard
a bed creak, as if someone had sat up suddenly,
and a voice, which she recognized as Duane's,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?  Is there anything the
matter?"  Kitty gave a little chuckle, then
answered softly, "Couldn't say exactly, only
I should guess most of the juniors of this
dormitory are taking a little nocturnal
airing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, indeed!  Well, I'll soon make sure
of that."
</p>

<p>
The bed creaked once again as Duane turned
out of it.  Kitty, now wide awake, and feeling
rather amused and curious, slipped quietly out
too.  The head of the dormitory, looking very
tall and striking in a vividly-red dressing-gown,
emerged at the same time, a lighted candle in
her hand.  She crossed to the opposite cubicle
and, without ceremony, drew back the curtain.
The cubicle was empty.  Quickly she made a
round of the dormitory; the nine cubicles
occupied by juniors were all deserted.  The only
occupants of the dormitory at that moment were
herself, Kitty and Hilary, who could be heard
breathing deeply and steadily, soundly asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we follow them, and see what they're
up to?" asked Kitty eagerly, only too willing
for an adventure.
</p>

<p>
"No fear!" replied Duane with a yawn.
"Bed for me.  They'll only be gorging
themselves in the common-room, I expect.  Little
wretches!  It'll do in the morning.  Good
night."  Yawning again, she went off into her
cubicle, carrying the light with her.
</p>

<p>
Kitty hesitated, disappointed, but not caring
to switch on one of the lights, and at last
decided that, under the circumstances, the most
discreet thing to do was to follow Duane's
example.  In ten minutes, the latter was breathing
as regularly and as evenly as Hilary.  Kitty,
lying awake, heard the delinquents return, and
grinned to herself as she thought of their
surprise in the morning.  The head prefect, for
once, evidently intended to exert her authority
and enforce discipline.
</p>

<p>
Directly after morning lessons were over, at
half past twelve, the nine juniors who slept in
Dormitory A were summoned to their head
prefect's study.  Here they found Duane, Hilary
and Kitty.  The last named had much ado to
refrain from smiling as the nine sheepish-looking
juniors endeavoured to squeeze themselves into
the little room.  In the foreground was Peggy
O'Nell, always the chief spokesman for the
juniors.  She was in the Fourth, an active,
mercurial girl with a mop of thick black curls,
sparkling blue eyes and a mischievous smile.
She had won her position as leader of the
juniors through sheer force of personality, and
perhaps enjoyed a larger share of popularity
than any other girl in the house.  Close behind
her was her faithful follower and shadow, little
Erica Salter, Bertha's sister.
</p>

<p>
The friendship between the two was a
curious one, for Erica was several years Peggy's
junior and in the lowest form.  She was a slim,
fair-haired, fairy-like child, of rather a timid
nature.  In no respect did she resemble her
sister Bertha.  She adored the high-spirited,
masterful Peggy with a slavish devotion; in
her eyes Peggy could do no wrong.  On the
other hand, Erica was petted and made much
of by the rest of the dormitory, because she was
the youngest, the "baby."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find standing room, if there's
nowhere to sit down," remarked Duane, in an
affable drawl.  "Would you mind shutting the
door behind you?  Thanks so much.  Now we
can get to business.  I suppose you won't
deny the fact that all nine of you left your
dormitory in the middle of last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't be much good, would it?"
replied Peggy, somewhat impudently.
</p>

<p>
Duane ignored the impudence, and went on
in the same tone:
</p>

<p>
"I also presume you are aware that, since
a girl broke her leg last year at that same trick,
it is one of the strictest house rules that girls
are not to leave their dormitories after lights
out, except in cases of necessity."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Peggy, "but I've heard you say
yourself that rules are like piecrust&mdash;made to be
broken."
</p>

<p>
"True, my child, but that was before I was
made a prefect."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're not prefects&mdash;yet."
</p>

<p>
"Then allow me to point out that, if you
wish to indulge in rule-breaking you must so
manage it that prefects don't get to know of it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," interrupted Hilary, "you wouldn't
mind enlightening us as to the reason for this
midnight excursion?"
</p>

<p>
Silence!
</p>

<p>
The nine exchanged glances and glowered at
the tall figure of their head prefect with sullen
determination.  Duane waited a few moments,
then said, with bland deliberation:
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you are going to refuse to
make a clean breast of the whole affair the matter
is beyond me.  I shall simply have to report
it to Miss Carslake and let her deal with you."
</p>

<p>
The juniors started, and exchanged frightened
glances.  Lines or order marks from prefects
were not unusual punishments and could be put
up with, but "reported to house mistress" was
a far more serious affair, and a rare occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Duane crossed her arms behind her head and
lounged back comfortably in her chair, with the
agreeable sensation of being mistress of the
situation.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she said, serenely.  "Peggy, you
seem to be the leader of the party."
</p>

<p>
Peggy gulped.  "We&mdash;we&mdash;were only having
a supper down in the common-room."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see.  That was what I surmised.
There's generally some light refreshment
attached to your little affairs.  Most thrilling!
Barbara, suppose you tell me what were the
eatables in this repast of yours."
</p>

<p>
Barbara giggled.  It seemed to be an incurable
affliction with her.  "Oh&mdash;er&mdash;sandwiches
and cakes and&mdash;and lemon jelly.  We took our
soap dishes down to eat it from and made it
in a Moab&mdash;I mean a wash-jug.  And&mdash;and,"
here Barbara, rather singularly, hesitated and
blushed furiously, "pork pies."
</p>

<p>
"H'm.  Quite a feast!  I almost wish I
had been invited," murmured the head prefect.
"Pork pies, too!  Now, I wonder&mdash;" she paused,
as a sudden thought struck her, and repeated
again, "pork pies!  Of course, there isn't any
connexion between the&mdash;er&mdash;title of your society
and that article of diet?  I have often wondered
what P. Squared stood for."
</p>

<p>
The faces of the juniors were a study.  Peggy
boiled over with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's where we did get the title
from," she flung out defiantly, "and&mdash;and&mdash;it's
beastly mean of you to get it out of us like
this.  I half believe somebody told you."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, merely intuition&mdash;aided by
Barbara's self-conscious blush," assured Duane.
"I suppose the eating of pork pies at the
beginning of each meeting constitutes a sacred
ceremony.  Oh well, I was young myself once.
You do great credit to Miss Green's teaching.
I must congratulate you on the intelligent
way in which you have learnt algebra.
Correlation of subjects, too, is one of the modern
crazes."
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Well, thank you for your frankness.  I
will think the matter over and decide on the
sentence.  There's dinner bell, so you'd better
clear," and at the words of dismissal from the
head prefect, who had become aware that the
other two seniors were no longer able to
control their merriment, the nine juniors gladly
made their escape.  As they disappeared
Hilary's face sobered suddenly.  She turned
to Duane.
</p>

<p>
"You'll report 'em, I suppose?  It's the
only way to stop these silly societies.  One
wouldn't mind them, of course, but these kids
are far more enthusiastic over a cricket match
between P. Squareds and Budmushes than one
between Carslake's and another house, and
when they actually cut school matches because
their blessed society is running a picnic or has
a jape on against the other one, it's getting
more than a joke."
</p>

<p>
Such was the point of view of the seniors.
</p>

<p>
Among the juniors there was great indignation
when Miss Carslake called them together
and, as a punishment for rule-breaking and
rowdyism, forbade the formation of secret
societies among themselves.  Rarely did Miss
Carslake arouse herself to such severity, but
perhaps she also was beginning to realize the
backslidings of her house.
</p>

<p>
The juniors were treated to a long lecture
in which the house mistress advised them to
devote their energies to more worthy and less
childish objects, and especially to endeavour
to raise the "tone" of the house and its
prestige in the school.  This could only be
done by combining, with their seniors, to form
a united house.  Then complaints from form
mistresses of careless preparation, reports from
prefects of disciplinary troubles would cease,
and both the work and the play of the house
would reach a higher level.
</p>

<p>
She left behind her an audience simmering
with indignation, wrath and outraged pride.
</p>

<p>
"Back up the prefects indeed!" cried
Peggy.  "Prefects like ours?  No fear!
Duane is a beastly sneak, that's what she is.
Other prefects don't report little things like
that.  She did it on purpose to put a stop to
the P. Squareds and Budmushes."
</p>

<p>
Daisy Carteret, leader of the Budmushes,
was as indignant as Peggy.  An indignation
meeting was held until the descent of an irate
mistress upon the common-room, demanding
what their prefects were doing not to put a
stop to the din, summarily put an end to the
proceedings.  Thus nothing came of the indignation
meeting, but after Miss Carslake's drastic
measures the atmosphere in the house was
charged with a good deal of electricity.
</p>

<p>
Duane took no notice of the hostility of the
juniors, apparently believing it the wisest&mdash;and
easiest&mdash;plan to let their indignation burn
itself out, as no doubt it would do in time.
She said nothing, even when one evening, on
passing through the common-room in the company
of three other Upper Fifth-formers, there
was an audible hiss from one of the juniors.
Duane walked on with her usual leisurely gait,
Hilary flushed crimson, and France, who had
been thinking out a colour scheme for a design,
looked round in a bewildered fashion.
</p>

<p>
But Kitty stopped dead, then swung round
and spoke curtly and coldly.  "May I ask
who that was meant for?"
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Kitty.  That wasn't meant
for you, nor for France.  You're a sport all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad of that&mdash;for your sakes," said
Kitty, still curtly, "and I should be still more
obliged if it wasn't meant for anyone else, not
when she's in <i>my</i> company, at any rate," and
she passed on, leaving the juniors a little taken
aback.
</p>

<p>
As she caught the others up in the passage,
she said involuntarily, lowering her tone, "if
I were a prefect I'd never allow them to do
that to me.  Why do you, Duane?"
</p>

<p>
Duane looked at her.  Kitty had quite a
shock when she saw the unmistakable, and for
once unconcealed, hostility in the other's sleepy
grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You happen to enjoy their popularity, you
see," Duane replied, coldly.  "Besides, you're
not a prefect.  It isn't all jam to be head
prefect&mdash;at least, the jam's only there to hide the
bread underneath."
</p>

<p>
"A sort of gilded pill," laughed Kitty, to
hide her discomfiture, but Duane walked on
without reply.  Kitty felt a little miserable as
she brushed out her thick brown crop that night.
"I was right from the beginning," she thought.
"I knew the Hon. Duane and I would never hit
it off.  It's rotten having your own head prefect
for an enemy."
</p>

<p>
Girls in the other houses raised expressive
eyebrows when, next Wednesday afternoon, on
the important occasion of the tennis match
between Carslake's and Prince's, while there
was a goodly proportion of the juniors of the
latter house in attendance to support their
players, the Carslake juniors were chiefly
conspicuous by their absence.
</p>

<p>
"Sulking," explained France airily to Vanda.
"Had a row with 'em last week.  They'll come
round in time."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me you are always having rows
in Carslake's," retorted Vanda, dryly.
</p>

<p>
Carslake's lost the match, but they put up
a better fight than was expected.  Kitty, indeed,
played brilliantly again, and as a result received
her first colour from the hands of Vanda.  She
was delighted at the honour of being chosen to
represent the school, though her pleasure was
rather spoilt when several of the juniors were
heard to rejoice openly that she had been given
the preference over Duane.
</p>

<p>
May passed in a blaze of sunshine and ended
on a more hopeful note for Carslake's, the house
gaining their first and most welcome cricket
victory over Green's.  They had previously lost
to Sheerston's (who possessed a very strong
side), leading into the field a team that had
perforce to be composed largely of juniors, for
Bertha was in bed with a severe cold, and
Sonia was but a broken reed where games were
concerned.  After the dismissal of Duane and
Kitty, except for a dogged stand by Daisy
Carteret, the rest of Carslake's innings was a
mere "procession," so that when the house
next took the field against Green's, Paddy
could be heard loudly propounding an original
riddle to the scorers in the pavilion.
</p>

<p>
"Why is Carslake's cricket team like a tadpole?"
</p>

<p>
"Because one day it'll be a frog," hazily
returned Hilary, who was in her usual post
as scorer for her house.
</p>

<p>
"No, silly, because it's chiefly tail," retorted
Paddy, triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"You mean, 'and thereby hangs a tale,'"
said Hilary, solemnly, refusing to see the point
since it was made against her side.
</p>

<p>
However, although Carslake's only succeeded
in making a moderate total themselves, Kitty's
bowling was more successful this time.  She
not only bowled overhand with remarkable
accuracy for a girl, but managed to make the
ball break in a formidable fashion; and
supported by some really smart ground fielding and
catching on the part of the juniors, she
dismissed Green's for a more moderate total still,
leaving Carslake's victors by about a dozen runs.
</p>

<p>
This triumph acted as a badly needed tonic,
and when, a week later, the house also defeated
Green's at tennis, the seniors began to
congratulate themselves that the "bad time" was
over and the house was at last looking up.
Alas! no one had the slightest presentiment of
the trouble that Fate had in store for them
before that term was ended.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE RICHOTER SCIENCE PRIZE
</h3>

<p>
Everybody at Easthampton, new girls
and old, knew all about the Richoter
Science Prize.  That and the Essay Medal
were the "scholastic plums" of the year, as
Hilary said.  This year Salome, the head
prefect of Sheerston's, was undoubtedly the
favourite for the science prize.  But a good
deal of excitement was aroused when Duane,
after returning from a rather mysterious
interview with the Principal, announced somewhat
lugubriously that Miss St. Leger strongly
advised her to enter for the Richoter, and
that Miss Vacher spoke highly of her natural
ability at the subject and considered that she
had a very good chance, if she did her best,
of winning the prize.
</p>

<p>
The other Carslake heroes naturally thought
this a brilliant notion on the part of the
Principal.  Their house would now have a candidate
to represent it, and if, by any chance, Duane
managed to win the prize, what a triumph for
Carslake's!  They solemnly assured their
doleful-looking head prefect that they would help
her as much as they possibly could.
</p>

<p>
The Upper Fifth, as a whole, freely gave
their opinions on this new entry for the
Richoter.  Duane, they said, though a slacker,
was undoubtedly clever at some things, and
would be a worthy opponent for Salome and
Eileen Gilbert and the other five or six
candidates.  Whereupon Kitty, her enthusiasm for
her house catching fire from that of the girls
of Sheerston's, Prince's and Green's, called out
in her clear, decided way, a remark which she
would afterwards have given worlds to have
left unsaid, though it meant little or nothing
at the time.
</p>

<p>
"Duane will be something more than a
worthy opponent to your girls.  She's going
to win that prize, and we're going to use every
means in our power to bring it off.  You mark
my words."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Kitty," remonstrated Hilary, a little
later, "you needn't be so deadly certain that
Duane will win the Richoter."
</p>

<p>
Kitty laughed.  "When I hear the other
houses boasting that one of their own girls is
practically sure of the prize, I simply have to
up and boast a bit for our poor old house.  No
one else will."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, that's all right.  Only if Duane
doesn't get it, you'll be twitted no end," warned
Hilary.
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  I can stand that.  Besides, Duane
isn't going to lose.  Why, this is Carslake's
Great Opportunity!"  Several other girls,
passing by, caught the last two sentences and
smiled, half amusedly, half curiously, at Kitty's
emphatic words and tone.
</p>

<p>
There were only three weeks before the
exam, but as all students know, quite a lot of
swotting can be done in three weeks if it doesn't
matter about neglecting other things.  The
Carslake seniors were as good as their word.
"Even better," as Duane remarked dryly, to
which Margaret said reproachfully, "Why, I
do believe we're more enthusiastic over it than
you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Especially Kitty," returned Duane, with
a half-mocking, half-quizzical glance at Kitty
that made her flush hotly.
</p>

<p>
The other prefects, Hilary and France,
willingly took upon themselves disciplinary duties
which usually fell to the head prefect's lot, in
order to give her more time for study.  Kitty
industriously copied out lists of game practices,
weekly reports, notices of sports or debate
meetings, and similar things which were part
of the head girl's routine, while much of
Duane's ordinary preparation was excused.  All
this help was accepted by the head prefect
readily enough, until it came to assistance in
early morning rising.  Hilary and Kitty held
themselves responsible for seeing that she was
out of bed ten minutes before rising bell,
dressed by the time the bell rang, and ready
for three-quarters of an hour's hard study
before breakfast.  To this Duane most strongly
objected, using the passive form of resistance,
and it says much for the patience and firmness
of Hilary and Kitty that, right up to the exam
itself, Duane was downstairs every morning
soon after the rising bell.
</p>

<p>
It must be admitted, however, that to
achieve this record, Hilary had to resort to a
novel stratagem suggested by Kitty's fertile
brain.  This was the innocent plan of tying
one end of a piece of cord round Duane's ankle
after she was in bed, and letting the other end
hang by Hilary's bedside.  Thus a good strong
pull from Hilary woke Duane effectually from
slumber.  This worked very well the first couple
of mornings, but on the third Duane declined to
get out of bed merely because her leg was
jerked.  Whereupon Kitty and Hilary attached
another cord, to the victim's arm this time,
with the satisfactory result that next morning
an extremely vigorous pull on both cords jerked
her right out of bed and landed her amid a
heap of tumbled bedclothes upon the floor,
where she was not allowed to remain for long.
</p>

<p>
Carslake affairs, however, though much
improved, were not yet progressing with the
smoothness of well-oiled machinery.  The fiery
Peggy and her devoted satellites were frequently
coming into collision with the prefects, and
after one such incident, Peggy, brooding over
the lines she had been set that morning, was
not mistress of her temper at cricket practice
in the afternoon and disputed Duane's verdict
of l.b.w. against her.  The head prefect's temper
was also strained by the unusual amount of
work she was doing just before the Richoter,
and her customary imperturbable indifference
was ruffled and disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm acting as umpire," she said sharply.
"You had better get off the field if you don't
agree with my decision."
</p>

<p>
Peggy looked at her, flushing with resentment.
"What do you mean, Duane?"
</p>

<p>
"Mean?  What I say.  Either accept my
verdict or else clear off the field."
</p>

<p>
Peggy's hot flush faded.
</p>

<p>
"If I go now I'll never, never play in a
match again if you're captaining the team,"
she said, in a voice that trembled with anger
and humiliation.  Duane shrugged her shoulders
indifferently.
</p>

<p>
"Please yourself.  Your services aren't
indispensable," she returned, coldly.
</p>

<p>
Peggy dropped her bat and walked off
defiantly.  Little Erica Salter, with a glance
of mingled fury and reproach at Duane for
treating her idol thus, rushed off the field after
her retreating figure.  The juniors looked at
each other uncomfortably, several being
obviously inclined to follow her example.  Then
Kitty sang out cheerily, "Come along!  Who's
going in next?  It's my turn to bowl, and I
hate wasting time, you know."  The girls
turned to her with relief, and for the rest of
the time it was Kitty's personality which
dominated the game, while Duane stood silently
watching.
</p>

<p>
A little later, coming down the passage in
her unhurried way, Duane nearly ran into
Erica.  The child's face was flushed and her
eyes bright.  She looked very pretty and
childish as she planted herself in front of the
head prefect.  The latter had perforce to stop too.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Erica," she said, "do you want anything?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the child, fixing her bright
eyes on the tall figure of the head prefect and
clenching her little hands.  "Only&mdash;only to
tell you that I think you're simply hateful."
</p>

<p>
"And why, pray, this flattering opinion of
me?" inquired Duane lazily, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can laugh," said Erica, stamping
her foot angrily.  "But I think you were
simply horrid to Peggy this afternoon and I
hate you for it.  I hope you'll have something
nasty happen to you some day, and then p'r'aps
you'll be sorry you've been so nasty to other
people."
</p>

<p>
"Peggy will get over it all right in a day or
two.  She'll be quite a nice girl in a couple of
years, when she's rubbed off the edges.  Don't
worry your head over her&mdash;or me either.  Go
along and play with your dolls."
</p>

<p>
"Dolls!" said Erica, scornfully.  "I don't
play with dolls now.  I'm much too big."
</p>

<p>
Duane looked down at her with a sudden
twinkle in her eyes.  "You're not very big
though.  But I do believe you're the prettiest
little kid in the school."
</p>

<p>
She stooped suddenly, caught the child
impulsively in her arms and kissed her.  Erica
indignantly struggled free and ran off down the
passage as hard as she could.  Ten minutes
later, Duane, with wrinkled brows, was plunged
deep in a last skim through a chapter on
chlorine, Peggy and such minor disturbances
completely forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The examination opened with two written
papers on the first day.  The second day was
devoted to the more important half of the
exam, the practical work.  The laboratory was
given over entirely to the use of the candidates;
balances had been carefully cleaned and
adjusted, as all knew that accurate results
depended very largely upon accurate weighing
and measuring; everything else that would
be required had been put in order.
</p>

<p>
Just after half-past twelve the candidates
came trooping out in a body, Miss Vacher,
looking intensely important, bringing up the
rear and locking the door.  They were met in
the hall by a large crowd of girls who were eager
to know what they had been doing, but
inquiries for details only resulted in the victims
walking off arm-in-arm with their own particular
chums.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't ask any more questions," begged
Eileen.  "Give us a rest till we go back to it
this afternoon.  Yes, Gwen, we're working three
at a bench.  I'm at the one just inside the door,
in the middle, with Salome on my right and
Duane on my left.  In good company, you see.
No, we're only allowed to speak to Miss Vacher."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Duane, accompanied by the Carslake
seniors, went off to her study, where she
dropped into the easy-chair with an air of
fatigue, while the others disposed themselves
on the table and such chairs as the little room
possessed.
</p>

<p>
"We don't begin again till half-past two,
one comfort," said Duane dreamily.  "Give us
plenty of time to digest our dinners.  I hope
the analysis of my compound works out right."
</p>

<p>
"Let us know if it does, won't you?" said
France eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly," replied Duane.  "I believe
mine will come right," she added reflectively.
"I've a sort of feeling it will."
</p>

<p>
"In your bones, I presume," suggested Kitty
maliciously.  Kitty was always rubbed up the
wrong way by Duane's airy manner of treating
even serious things.
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," assented Duane at once.
"Only I hope," anxiously, "it won't turn out
to be rheumatism after all."
</p>

<p>
Kitty laughed.  "Scored off me there," she
said frankly.  "Hallo, who's this?"
</p>

<p>
"This" proved to be a junior from one of
the other houses.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Duane," she said, "I've
come from Miss Vacher.  She wants a pipette
out of the laboratory at once.  I think she's
doing some experimental work in her room and
she said, as you had the key, would you mind
fetching a pipette for her?  She hopes it won't
be troubling you, and I'll take it back with me."
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth has Washer given the key
to you, Cato?" asked France, looking surprised.
</p>

<p>
"To mind it for her," replied Duane, with a
laugh.  "You know what a bother there was
last year when poor old Washer lost the key in
the dinner-hour, and how eventually they had
to break open the door and get in.  Washer was
dreadfully upset and didn't want a repetition of
it this year, so she handed the key over to me
after we got outside, and asked me to keep it
till we went in again this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh at Duane's explanation.
Inside the laboratory Miss Vacher was
as keen and as capable as Miss St. Leger
herself.  Away from science, she was the most
hopelessly absent-minded person it was possible
to imagine.  She kept an army of small girls
constantly employed looking around for her
possessions.
</p>

<p>
However, everybody seemed to take the
explanation for granted, though Kitty <i>did</i> think
that the science mistress's eccentricities were
responsible for a state of affairs that was not
quite what it should be.  Still, it was certainly
not her place to say so.
</p>

<p>
Duane was eyeing the small messenger
ruefully.  "Oh, bother Miss Vacher!  What on
earth does she want a pipette for just before
dinner!  It isn't soup day.  I'm so comfortably
settled too, and having a few minutes' rest.  I
say, kid, if I gave you the key, couldn't you
slip along and get it?"
</p>

<p>
The girl looked doubtful.  "Better go
yourself, Duane," advised Hilary.  "You know the
lab's out of bounds to-day for us folk.  I
shouldn't send a junior, in case of an
accident."
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not," agreed Duane.  "I
shouldn't like to get anyone into trouble.  Still,
it's an awful bore," and she yawned as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go if you like," Kitty volunteered.  "I
know where the pipettes are kept&mdash;over by the
window&mdash;and it won't take me a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks ever so much," said Duane.
"You're a brick.  Here's the key.  Of course,
there's no need to advise you to give a wide
berth to our experiments."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," replied Kitty.  "I shan't
go near the benches.  I'll be back in a
tick."  She disappeared with a nod, and in a few
minutes returned and handed over pipette and
key to Duane, who slipped the key into her
pocket and gave the pipette to the junior.
"Here you are.  Trot it along&mdash;with Duane's
love&mdash;and don't smash it on the way.  Be sure
you don't forget the love."
</p>

<p>
"Vacher was always rather smitten with
you," remarked Bertha with a grin.  "Now,
any of the others would have handed the key
over to Salome.  She's your senior really."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, queer taste on Washer's part, isn't
it?" returned Duane complacently.
</p>

<p>
"Very," said France, bursting into a laugh.
"However, you make a very well-matched pair."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose you're thinking that
opposites meet," replied Duane, undisturbed.
"There's only one thing in which Washer and
I are alike."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Our genius for science."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's hope your genius will pull off
the Richoter for you," put in Kitty.  "Then
Carslake's can crow for once in its life.  There's
the dinner bell.  You'll see our Richoter candidate
doesn't faint this afternoon through lack
of nourishment, won't you, France?"
</p>

<p>
By two o'clock that afternoon the four
houses were quiet and deserted, all except the
Richoter candidates being in their classrooms.
Little did they dream, as the clock hand pointed
to the half hour and then crept onwards, of the
drama that was being enacted even then in the
science laboratory.
</p>

<p>
The nine candidates had assembled punctually
at two-thirty; Duane had handed over
the key to Miss Vacher and, Miss St. Leger
also with them, they had entered the room and
taken up their former places to continue their
work.
</p>

<p>
There was several minutes' silence while the
girls began to take their compounds from the
midget furnaces, preparatory to weighing.  Miss
St. Leger and Miss Vacher were talking together
in low tones when a sudden exclamation from
Salome made them glance up quickly.  With an
expression of amazement on her face the girl
was gazing at one of the pans which she had
just removed from her balance; underneath the
pan was a small gravel pebble attached to the
pan by means of a piece of plasticine.  She
swung round quickly as the Principal's voice,
from just behind her, said sharply: "Has
someone been interfering with your balances,
Constance?"  (Constance was Salome's
baptismal name.)
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-070"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-070.jpg" alt="&quot;'Has someone been interfering with your balances, Constance?' asked the Principal.&quot;">
<br>
&quot;'Has someone been interfering with your balances, Constance?' <br>
asked the Principal.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;it seems so, Miss St. Leger," stammered
Salome.  "I tested my balances to see
if they were correct before weighing, and was
astonished to find one side much heavier than
the other.  Then I took off the pans to try and
find the cause and discovered this piece of
gravel underneath one of them."
</p>

<p>
The faces of the Principal and the science
mistress were very grave, for it looked as if a
deliberate attempt had been made to spoil
Salome's results.  Aware that the other girls
in the room had paused in their work to listen
in astonishment, Miss St. Leger said decidedly,
"Continue your work, girls.  Constance, I will
inquire into this as soon as you have all finished
your practical work.  Go on now with your
experiment."
</p>

<p>
The Principal stayed in the room till the
time allotted for the practical work was over,
then she called them all together round the
bench where Salome, Eileen and Duane had
been working and explained to them exactly
what had happened.  They looked at one
another with mingled feelings of discomfort
and amazement.
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger first questioned Salome.
"When did you use your balances last&mdash;I mean
before your discovery at the beginning of the
afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"This morning," replied Salome at once.
"Not long before we left.  We had to weigh
our compounds before putting them into the
midget furnaces to heat during the dinner hour."
</p>

<p>
"You are sure they were correct then?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite sure, Miss St. Leger.  I always lift
them before using, to test and correct them, if
necessary.  I distinctly remember testing them
this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Then that means that someone has tampered
with them between then and when we
returned," interposed Miss Vacher.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  But surely it was not possible
for anyone to touch them while you were
working in the room.  Constance, what do you
say?  You should be the best judge of that."
</p>

<p>
Salome raised her eyes frankly to the
Principal.  "I have been thinking of that, Miss
St. Leger.  It seems quite impossible to me.
I did not leave my place after the weighing
till we went out about ten minutes later."
</p>

<p>
"And the nearest girls to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Eileen and Duane, and they were right
at the farther ends of the benches.  I am quite
sure no girl in this room touched them then."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the last one to leave the room?"
</p>

<p>
"Eileen and I.  We came out together with
Miss Vacher."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite sure of that?  No one
was left behind, even for a half minute or so?
It could have been done in a few seconds."
</p>

<p>
"I was the last out, Miss St. Leger," replied
the science mistress, "and I locked the door
after me."
</p>

<p>
"Most extraordinary," said the Principal,
"and there is only one key to that lock in the
school.  We found <i>that</i> out last year.  The
key never left your possession during the dinner
hour, I suppose, Miss Vacher?"
</p>

<p>
The science mistress was looking far from
happy.  "The key was not in my possession,
Miss St. Leger.  After last year&mdash;I mean, owing
to my unfortunate absent-mindedness&mdash;I decided
to entrust it to somebody else.  Duane
took charge of it for me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Miss St. Leger's expression changed
abruptly.  No longer did she look puzzled, but
keen and alert.  "I am rather sorry for that.
However, Duane will be able to answer that
question for us."
</p>

<p>
Duane hesitated, looking across at the
science mistress.
</p>

<p>
"Only once, Miss St. Leger.  Miss Vacher
sent a junior asking me to get a pipette out of
the lab for her, as she wanted it for some
private work she was doing in her room.  I
was&mdash;was feeling rather lazy, so another girl
offered to fetch it for me."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the girl who fetched the pipette?"
</p>

<p>
"Kitty Despard."
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger nodded.  "Ah yes, I remember.
The girl from Australia, who came
at the beginning of the term.  When was this?"
</p>

<p>
"Just before dinner."
</p>

<p>
"How long was she gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"She gave the key back to you on her return?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do with it then?"
</p>

<p>
"I put it back into my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"And it stayed there till you handed it to
Miss Vacher?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"No one could have taken it and put it
back again unknown to you, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Duane shook her head decidedly.
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger turned to Eileen.
</p>

<p>
"Will you please see if you can find Kitty
Despard for me, Eileen, and ask her to come
here.  She is probably down on the playing-fields,
as afternoon lessons are over.  Don't say
anything to Kitty or anyone else about what is
happening here."
</p>

<p>
While Eileen was gone, the Principal again
turned to Duane.
</p>

<p>
"You are quite sure no one else had use
of the key except yourself and Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite sure, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;I am sorry to have to put this
question to you, Duane, but under the
circumstances I must.  You yourself never went
inside the laboratory during the time the key
was in your possession, and you have no
knowledge yourself of anyone who did so, except
Kitty Despard?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You give me your word of honour that
you have spoken the truth?"
</p>

<p>
Duane flushed, but replied:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
On Kitty's arrival in Eileen's wake, the
Principal turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent for you to ask you a few
questions.  The matter is rather a serious one,
and I want you to answer me very carefully."
</p>

<p>
Kitty looked in unmistakable astonishment
at the circle of serious faces around her.
</p>

<p>
"You came to the laboratory during the dinner
hour to-day to fetch a pipette for Miss Vacher?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty's look of wonderment became more marked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"You went straight in and fetched the pipette?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did you touch anything else in the room?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think so."
</p>

<p>
"You did not touch the girls' experiments
or their balances, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no.  I was specially careful not to
go near them."
</p>

<p>
"You did not see anyone else about?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the corridor was empty.  In fact, the
building seemed deserted."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt all the girls were in their houses
waiting for the dinner bell.  Are you quite
sure you locked the door when you left the
room?"
</p>

<p>
"Positive."
</p>

<p>
Here Miss Vacher interposed.  "Yes, we
found the door locked right enough when we
returned in the afternoon, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"One more question, Kitty.  You took the
key straight back to Duane?  No other girl
entered the laboratory while you had it?"
</p>

<p>
"No one, Miss St. Leger," replied Kitty,
shaking her head.
</p>

<p>
Then Miss St. Leger explained to the puzzled
senior what had happened, but Kitty, with
absolute candour, declared firmly that she had
not interfered with the balances and could offer
no explanation of the matter.  The other girls
said exactly the same, and there the inquiry
ended for the time being.
</p>

<p>
The Principal walked restlessly across the
room and stared out of the window into the
quad below.  "One thing is certain," she
remarked; "there are no ordinary means of
entry into this room except through the door.
Well, I shall probably call the whole school
together for a public inquiry.  Until then, I
want you girls to understand that I do not
wish the matter to go any farther.  That will
do, thank you, girls.  I am sorry I have had
to take up some of your time.  Miss Vacher
will take you into the Sixth Form room so
that you can write out your results before
tea-time."
</p>

<p>
Tea at Carslake's that day was the usual
cheery meal, and if Kitty and Duane were
unusually quiet and silent no one gave much
heed to them.  Consequently, it was quite a
shock to all except Kitty and Duane when,
directly tea was over, the house mistress gave
the order to assemble at once in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth's up now?" exclaimed
Hilary, as the little party of seniors made their
way across the quad to the school building on
the heels of their juniors.  "Duane, do you
know?"
</p>

<p>
The head prefect paused a moment before
she answered, "Yes, I think so, but you'll
know all about it in a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke they entered the hall, finding
it nearly full, with rank after rank of waiting
girls, all talking in subdued murmurs that
now and again broke into a clamorous buzz.
Silence fell abruptly as Miss St. Leger entered
and took her place on the dais at the farther
end of the hall.  The girls stood in their house
places, Sheerston's and Carslake's on the right
of the wide central gangway, Prince's and
Green's on the left.  The Principal then gave
the signal for calling-over, a customary
formality which only took place on special
occasions, and the four head prefects began
rapidly calling the names of the girls in their
own houses, each girl answering, "Present."  With
the calling-over the interest in the proceedings
increased, if possible, everyone being
given the impression that the occasion was a
serious one.
</p>

<p>
Amidst a breathless hush, the Principal
began to speak.
</p>

<p>
"You will be wondering, I know, why I
have assembled the whole school so suddenly.
I am sorry to say that the reason is a very
unpleasant one.  It is this.  A deliberate
attempt was made to spoil the chances of one
of the Richoter candidates in the practical
examination which, as you all know, took place
to-day.  You will be still more surprised to
hear," pausing as an amazed gasp ran round
the room, "that the girl upon whom this
despicable trick was attempted is one of the
most well-liked and esteemed&mdash;perhaps the most
popular girl in the school, the head prefect of
Sheerston's."  A low murmur was heard and
all heads turned involuntarily towards Salome,
who coloured all over her frank, open face,
then paled as swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"That this silly, stupid attempt failed most
lamentably does not, to me, make it any the
less serious."
</p>

<p>
The Principal then proceeded to explain
the nature of the experiment the candidates
were working, and the apparatus being used.
She gave the gist of the inquiry she had held
in the laboratory that afternoon, and then
went on to say:
</p>

<p>
"So you see, it certainly seems that the
only two girls who can throw any light on
this affair are Duane and Kitty.  If those two
girls will come forward I should like to question
them again before the school.  They have had
a little time since my first inquiry to think
things over and may have thought of
something which did not then occur to them."
</p>

<p>
Conscious that the gaze of every soul in
the room was on them, Duane and Kitty
advanced to Miss St. Leger's dais.  Of the
two, Duane betrayed the least emotion; her
calm imperturbability stood her in good stead
now.  Kitty was pale and trembling a little,
but she looked the Principal straight in the
face in her frank, fearless manner, and when
she spoke her voice was clear and steady.
</p>

<p>
"Do you still assert, Kitty, that you did
not touch the balances when you went into the
laboratory this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I did not touch them, Miss St. Leger,"
replied Kitty firmly.
</p>

<p>
"On your word of honour?"
</p>

<p>
"On my word of honour."
</p>

<p>
"You saw nobody near the laboratory when
you were there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss St. Leger," Kitty replied, and
a kind of sigh rustled round the listening ranks.
The Principal turned to Duane.
</p>

<p>
"The key did not pass out of your charge
except when Kitty had it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"Where were you after dinner when the
rest of the girls had gone to afternoon lessons?"
</p>

<p>
"In my study, resting.  I stayed until it
was time to return to the laboratory."
</p>

<p>
"And during that time you did not go to
the laboratory yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss St. Leger."
</p>

<p>
"That will do, thank you.  You may go
to your places."
</p>

<p>
"Begorrah!" murmured Paddy under her
breath to the next girl, "didn't she look right
through them!  I wonder they didn't sink
through the floor."
</p>

<p>
The Principal had turned to the girls and
was addressing the school again.
</p>

<p>
"If any girl here thinks she can throw any
light on this affair, can tell us anything that
we do not at present know, will she please
come forward now."
</p>

<p>
There was silence.  The girls looked from
one to another, but no one spoke or moved
out of her place.
</p>

<p>
"Someone in this room this evening is the
culprit," continued the Principal, in her most
impressive tones.  "I will make my appeal
to that girl, whoever she is.  If she is sorry
for an impulsive, unconsidered act, the finest
way to show her repentance, and the way that
calls for most moral courage, would be to come
forward now in front of the whole school and
confess her guilty intentions."
</p>

<p>
Again the Principal paused and swept the
rows of upturned faces with earnest gaze.  Many
paled and looked uncomfortable and apprehensive,
but no one stirred or spoke and the
silence became so intense that one could have
heard a pin drop.
</p>

<p>
Then the Principal turned with a brisk
movement and the tension relaxed.
</p>

<p>
"I will not keep you any longer to-night,
girls.  I shall let the matter rest for a few
days, so that the culprit may have a second
chance.  If she has not the courage to come
forward and confess in front of the school, it
is my earnest hope that she will come to me in
private, remembering what I said a minute ago.
In the meantime I will ask you all to behave
quietly and sensibly and not start jumping to
any rash or foolish conclusions."
</p>

<p>
The assembly then broke up, the girls returning
to their own houses.  The Principal and the
mistresses lingered behind on the dais for a few
minutes.
</p>

<p>
"A most distressing thing to happen," Miss
Sheerston said in her incisive way.  "I would
have staked my head that there is not a girl
in my house capable of such an act."
</p>

<p>
The other three house mistresses emphatically
declared that they also would have placed
undisputed trust in every one of their older
girls.  There was no character in the school
who could be pointed out as flagrantly
dishonest.  Of course the younger girls were out
of the question; they did no science and were
incapable of thinking out such a plot.
</p>

<p>
But it was of Duane and Kitty that the
mistresses were thinking chiefly.  "It seems as
if one of them must be guilty," Miss St. Leger
said reflectively, "and one of them a head
prefect, too.  If only Duane could have
accounted for that half-hour or so alone after
dinner, then she would have been above
suspicion.  I hate the thought of suspecting her."
</p>

<p>
"Things look decidedly black against the
other girl, Kitty Despard," Miss Green pointed
out.  "We know she did go to the laboratory.
We have only her word that she didn't touch
the balance."
</p>

<p>
"And yet I am loath to suspect the girl,"
said Miss St. Leger ruefully.  "I liked her
straightforward, fearless look, and I reckon
myself a pretty good judge of character.  If
she is guilty, then she is the cleverest
hypocrite for a girl I have yet come across.  How
have you others found her?"
</p>

<p>
"I like her," said Miss Carslake.  "She is
not clever, but always bright and open, full of
high spirits but quite unassuming.  I thought
she had been doing a good deal to help the
improvement in the house."
</p>

<p>
"And a real sport on the field," added Miss
Bryce, the games mistress.  "I mean a sport
in the best sense of the word."
</p>

<p>
"What puzzles me," said Miss Sheerston,
"is the motive behind it all.  There must be
a motive of some sort, that is certain.
Constance told me herself she didn't know a single
girl in the school who disliked her or who bore
her a grudge.  The plasticine and gravel offer
no clue.  There is plenty of the former in the
lower form classrooms, used by the little ones
for map modelling and that sort of thing, while
the path outside is covered with small gravel."
</p>

<p>
Then Miss Prince proffered a suggestion.
"Do you think it is a question, not so much
of personal spite but of house rivalry, which as
you know is very keen, over examinations as
well as over games?  That idea excludes Miss
Sheerston's girls, of course."
</p>

<p>
"It might be," admitted the Principal.  "I
have always encouraged friendly house rivalry,
because it raises the standard of work and play.
But I should be extremely sorry and disappointed
if it has resulted in anything like this."

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
TRIAL BY JURY
</h3>

<p>
Kitty would have died rather than show
fear when questioned before the whole
school.  But as she made her way back to her
house after the inquiry her heart sank.  She
realized already that, unless something very
unexpected happened, she would be enveloped
in a cloud from which it might be impossible
to escape.  Suspicion rested upon her and Duane
alone, and she knew that if it came to choosing
between them, the unenviable choice of the girls
would most certainly fall upon her.  She had
actually gone to the laboratory; no one could
say that of Duane.  One could only say she
might have gone.  Besides, the girls would not
think lightly of doubting the word of one of
the head prefects, whom they had known for
years, while she, Kitty, was still little more
than a stranger from a remote land.
</p>

<p>
"I declare, I believe Duane knows more of this
affair than anyone else does, only she's got
the knack of keeping cool and never turning a
hair," thought Kitty to herself.
</p>

<p>
Instead of going straight to her study to
do her prep she made for the gym, feeling she
would like a few minutes' exercise before settling
down to work.  Just as she reached the quad
she ran into the very girl who was occupying
her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" she exclaimed, "going to the gym?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Duane in her slow drawl.
</p>

<p>
"Right-oh! we may as well go across
together, if you've no objection."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you like," replied Duane, though
a kind of frigidity came over her face, and her
grey eyes gazed coldly past, rather than at, the
girl to whom she was speaking.
</p>

<p>
Kitty said nothing for a minute, though her
sharp eyes noticed everything.  "I do believe,
in a way, she's afraid," she said to herself with
a curious kind of exaltation.  "Afraid of what
I might say to her."
</p>

<p>
Then as she fell into step beside Duane she
remarked quietly, "I wonder if it's dawned on
you yet that we're both of us in a beastly
awkward position?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you mean about that wretched key
business?" returned Duane, looking bored.
</p>

<p>
"You know perfectly well I do," said Kitty,
rather sharply.  "So why pretend otherwise?
You know it's between you and me.  You
didn't lend that key to anyone else, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I answered that question at the
inquiry."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't get your wool off.  What I
mean is, you didn't tell a lie to shield
anyone?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I certainly did not," replied Duane,
still very coldly.  "I am not in the habit of
telling lies to shield others from the consequences
of their own acts.  If people wish to do such
things they must first make sure they have
the courage to face it out afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Kitty thought to herself that Duane seemed
to have nerve enough to face anything, despite,
or perhaps because of, her lethargic temperament.
But aloud she said, "Only, you see, I know I
never touched the wretched balance.  I never
went near it.  And if I didn't, who did?"
</p>

<p>
By this time they had reached the door of
the gym.  As she put her last query Kitty
turned and faced Duane, looking her straight
in the eyes.  The head prefect's expression did
not change; save for a slight curling of her lip,
not a muscle in her face moved.
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of asking me?  I was
never clever at guessing riddles," and with that
she pushed the gym door open and walked in
without taking any further notice of Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Failed dismally in the first round between
us, Kitty, my child," muttered Kitty to herself.
"I didn't get much out of her, did I?  And yet,
it only makes me more certain that she knows
something about it, in spite of her denials.  An
absolutely innocent girl would have been decent
over it and met me half-way.  She was hardly
polite to me, and our head prefect has such
beautiful manners as a rule.  Well, she evidently
intends to let me pay the piper."
</p>

<p>
Changing her mind suddenly, she turned
away from the gym without entering and went
back to the seclusion of her own study.  The
rest of the evening passed very quietly in
Carslake's, everyone being busy with prep, and there
was little public discussion of the Richoter
affair.  Even in Dormitory A after bed bell
had gone, Hilary summarily put a stop to a
tentative attempt on the part of the juniors
to raise the subject.
</p>

<p>
The next day, the Richoter candidates heard
the pleasing intelligence that the Rev. R. Carstairs,
who was keenly interested in the science
prize and who always had a hand in its
organization, had invited them all to spend the day
at his house, punting on the river and picnicking
on its banks, with his lovely garden and strawberry
beds placed at their disposal.  Naturally
the nine girls in question, having received
permission to go, did not hesitate in accepting this
generous invitation.
</p>

<p>
With the absence of these senior girls, two
of whom were head prefects and several others
prefects, the houses felt themselves suddenly
free from a good deal of the control exercised
over them out of lesson hours.  Sheerston's and
Carslake's were without a head, and even Vanda
West, at that disturbing time, felt the loss of
Eileen's steady support.  Consequently, the girls
were a little out of hand that day, and Vanda
and Phyllis Knight, of Green's, were powerless
to check the conviction that ran like wildfire
round the school, that Kitty Despard was
known by the seniors to be the girl who had
meddled with the balances.  One rumour even
said that she had been seen coming out of the
First Form room on her way to the lab with a
piece of plasticine in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Cold looks were cast at Kitty by the Upper
Fifth in class that afternoon, and several cutting
remarks addressed by girls to their near
neighbours in her hearing made her cheeks burn.
When, on the playing-field, it was her turn to
bat, some of the juniors looking on hissed her
as she walked towards the pitch.  This was
more than Kitty could bear.  Throwing down
her bat she turned and faced them, flushed
and trembling with anger and indignation.
</p>

<p>
"What right have you to accuse me?  I
know I went into the laboratory, but that isn't
proof that I did it.  You may think what you
please.  I don't care.  I can only say that I
did not touch the balances, and if you won't
believe me I can't help it," and Kitty, feeling
nearly as desperate as her words, strode off the
pitch and left the field, her head still defiantly
erect.  But once out of sight of the girls some of
her defiant courage forsook her.  She threw
herself down in a solitary corner of the grounds,
hidden from the players by the swimming-bath.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd never come to this hateful
place.  The girls here are perfectly horrid.  As
if dad and the boys at home would ever dream
of doubting my word!  Oh dear! how on
earth shall I stick it here if they go on
suspecting me!  But I vow I won't.  I'd rather go
back home&mdash;or to another school."
</p>

<p>
When the Carslake seniors came out from
tea, a fresh notice on the board caught Hilary's
attention.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Seniors are invited to attend a Matter
of Special Interest and Import to All, in the
debating-room at 6.30 sharp.
</p>

<p>
"(Signed) Paddy, Sheerston's."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"One of Paddy's brilliant inspirations, I
suppose," commented Bertha with a slight sneer.
"Are you going, Hilary?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Hilary with a laugh.
"We had better turn up.  'Twouldn't do for
Carslake's not to be represented.  Margaret
will come too, I expect, and France, if she's
not too immersed in her latest Academy picture."
</p>

<p>
Paddy had intended that her little affair
should be patronized by the head prefects if
possible, and had written out personal
invitations for their benefit.  The Richoter
candidates had just returned from their outing,
laughing and talking light-heartedly, the shadow
of yesterday's events forgotten for the time
being, when a junior came up and presented
Duane and Salome with a note each.
</p>

<p>
"Only one of Paddy's bright schemes,"
chuckled Salome.  "I shall have to turn up to
keep everyone out of mischief, I suppose.
Coming, Duane?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Six-thirty!  There isn't
much time, is there?" replied Duane doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Half an hour.  Plenty of time to wash
and change.  We're let off prep, you know.
Come along.  Paddy and her confrères are
rather good when they get on the entertaining stunt."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  I shall probably be a bit late
though, as I have to see Miss Carslake.  However,
I'll put in an appearance."
</p>

<p>
"By the by," one of the other seniors interjected,
"I suppose nothing fresh has turned up
about that beastly balance affair?"
</p>

<p>
Salome grimaced, then shook her head.  "I
asked Phyllis as I passed her just now by the
gates and she shouted back, 'No.'  I guess it
will remain a mystery for ever.  I wish to
goodness I'd pulled off the gravel without Prinny
or anyone seeing me."
</p>

<p>
Goodly numbers of seniors made their appearance
punctually at six-thirty and took their
seats.  When the room was full, Paddy, clad in
a tattered gown and a battered old mortar-board,
vigorously rang the lesson bell for silence.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," she began.  "I see
upon the smiling faces around me the predominant
expression of curiosity.  I do not wish
to keep you on tenterhooks, my dear
fellow-labourers, so I will get on with the business
right away.  It has come to my ears recently
that a grievous crime against the justice of this
country has been perpetrated.  One of the
members of this community has been cast into
prison without a trial.  Now, my dear friends,
you may not have read for the Bar, like myself;
you may not even have perused that delightful
little text-book entitled 'Raleigh's Elementary
Politics,' but at least you have all studied, with
keen enjoyment, King John and Magna Carta
in history lessons&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Cheers and groans from the audience were
followed by a strange and dubious silence as
the meaning underlying Paddy's high-flown
speech dawned upon them.  The girls cast
uneasy glances at each other, not liking the turn
affairs had taken.  Surely enough fuss had
already been made over that Richoter affair,
and anyway, there couldn't be much doubt
but that Kitty Despard had done it.  Paddy
was carrying it a bit too far this time, they said
to themselves.  There might be trouble if Miss
St. Leger got to know.
</p>

<p>
Someone voiced the opinion of the assembly
by calling out, "What price the inquiry in the
Hall last night?  Don't you count that?"
</p>

<p>
There was silence.
</p>

<p>
Paddy gravely produced a huge pair of
horn-rimmed spectacles and perched them on her
nose, then gazed freezingly in the direction of the voice.
</p>

<p>
"The honourable gentleman over there is
surely suffering from delirium tremens.  If the
honourable gentleman will wait until he hears
the charge&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a laugh from some of the girls.
Salome, who had half risen from her seat,
dropped back into it.  The girls began to
realize it was evidently only one of Paddy's
jokes; there would be nothing serious and
unpleasant happening, after all.
</p>

<p>
"As you have already guessed," went on
Paddy briskly, "we propose holding a proper
trial by jury this evening.  The first step is
to arrange the court.  I will read out the names
of the officers already appointed and they will
kindly take their places at once.  Having, as
you will doubtless acknowledge, the keenest
discernment and the readiest wit of you all,
I have great pleasure in accepting the part
of the Judge myself.  Our learned friend,
Mr. Frederick Lightfoot, K.C., and Mr. William
Pimple will be counsel for the defence and the
Crown respectively."
</p>

<p>
Amid general laughter Paddy's two chums,
Flo Lessingham and Kathleen Morris, came
forward and took their places, having been
previously coached in the parts they had to
play.  Paddy had two objects in view in
organizing this meeting.  One was the sheer
desire for fun; in Paddy's estimation, all things
were legitimate objects for fun.  Secondly, she
sincerely wished to help Kitty by turning into
ridicule much that was at present taken very
seriously by the girls.  She believed it would
relieve the tension all round and make things
a good deal easier for the Australian girl, whom
she had always liked and whom she was loath
to believe dishonourable.
</p>

<p>
Significant looks were again exchanged when
Kathleen Morris brought an action against "a
well-known desperado, known among his
intimates as Kangaroo": glances, however,
which ended in laughter as the charge was
read out.  The criminal was accused of entering
Mrs. Mellish's shop and stealing two ounces
of bull's eyes and a bar of Fry's chocolate.
By this time some dim notion of Paddy's
underlying purpose began to creep into Kitty's mind,
for she knew that Paddy was one of the few
who had championed her cause.  At any rate,
she would show them that she, Kitty Despard,
was not afraid of facing any trial by jury, in
farce or otherwise.  Paddy would rely on her
to do so.  So it was with head erect and a
smile on her lips that she walked up to the
"dock," and faced the girls with a free,
fearless mien.
</p>

<p>
It was just at this moment that Duane
entered, subsided quietly into a seat by the
door and glanced round the room in idle
curiosity.  A puzzled look crept into her face.
What on earth were they all up to?  Then,
as she listened and gazed toward the "dock"
with increasing attention, the puzzled look
slowly changed to one of realization and at
the same time another expression crept into
her eyes&mdash;quite a different expression.  It
almost looked like horror.
</p>

<p>
The girls had been insensibly impressed by
Kitty's fearless bearing.  As she stood there
she certainly looked the last kind of girl to be
accused of anything dishonourable or despicable.
Salome drew her straight brows together
and her face became very thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Van," she murmured under her breath
to the head prefect of Prince's, "I believe that
girl's telling the truth when she says she didn't
touch my balances.  Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"But Salome, if <i>she</i> didn't, it must have
been&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said Salome with a quick gesture.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't believe that either.  Bother
it all!"
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner at the Bar," Paddy was saying
with awful solemnity.  "Are you or are you
not guilty of this terrible and most depraved
crime?"
</p>

<p>
"Not guilty," replied Kitty, clearly and
unhesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"We will now call the first witness,"
resumed Paddy, who had her witnesses ready
in the adjoining room and was confident of
the effect of their absurd appearance upon the
audience.  "Constable&mdash;&mdash;"  She broke off
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
There was a quick gasp from the audience;
everyone became rigid.  One of the listening
girls had sprung to her feet, and now strode
impetuously into the centre of the room.  It
was Duane, her face strangely pale, her habitual
lazy, unemotional expression gone, giving place
to a curious look of uncertainty, doubt, fear,
even horror.  One of the girls possessed with
a vivid imagination afterwards described it
with relish as a "sort of haunted look."
</p>

<p>
She had jumped to her feet as if impelled
by some force outside her own volition; she
spoke now, impulsively, stammeringly, the words
breaking from her as if she hardly knew what
she was saying, twisting her fingers together and
looking from side to side.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?  What rubbish is all
this?  I&mdash;it can't go on, Paddy.  Kitty didn't
do it, I tell you.  I&mdash;you see, I know she didn't
do it.  I&mdash;I'm not quite such a cad as to&mdash;I
can't tell you exactly."  She broke off abruptly.
Her glance crossed Kitty's.  The Australian
met hers steadfastly, unwaveringly.  The prefect's
pale face flushed crimson, and again words
broke from her stammeringly.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-100"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-100.jpg" alt="&quot;'What rubbish is all this?' Duane asked.&quot;">
<br>
&quot;'What rubbish is all this?' Duane asked.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm sorry.  I have done you an
injustice."  Again she broke off, checking
herself as if she suddenly realized what she was
saying, drew in her breath with a quick gasp
and caught at the back of her chair to steady herself.
</p>

<p>
There was a dead silence for the space of
ten seconds.  The faces of the girls were a
study.  Duane had certainly betrayed herself
this time.  Her conscience must have been
pricking her badly, or the shock of hearing
Kitty arraigned, as she thought, for committing
a crime of which she was innocent would not
have made her give herself away so completely.
But having been absent all day, she was
probably unaware of the outbreak of feeling
against Kitty, and was not prepared for the shock.
</p>

<p>
She was silent now, and had pulled herself
together, regaining something of her usual
composure, though her agitation was still betrayed
by the nervous way she was biting her underlip.
</p>

<p>
But her guilt had been written unmistakably
on her face during that half-minute or so during
which she had lost control.
</p>

<p>
Paddy made a desperate and heroic effort to
get back to the state of "as you were."  Needless
to say, it failed dismally.  Nobody took any
notice of her, everyone being too occupied in
staring open-mouthed at Duane and Kitty.
</p>

<p>
The next minute Salome had pushed her
way forward.  She was one of the first to grasp
all that Duane's few, incoherent, impulsive words
must mean; certainly she was the first to act.
She went up to Duane and took her by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Duane, what on earth do you
mean by this bomb-shell?  If you can prove
that Kitty is innocent, for goodness' sake hurry
up and do so."
</p>

<p>
Duane looked at Salome.  "Well, Salome,"
she said in a low voice and with a nervous little
laugh.  "To tell you the truth I hardly realize
what I did say just now.  I&mdash;I lost my head
a bit, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I think you did," Salome agreed grimly.
"Anyway, you've properly upset your own
apple-cart, as far as the girls here are concerned."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Salome was no shirker.  "I mean everybody
here is practically convinced now that you and
not Kitty Despard were responsible for faking
the balances.  Personally, I'm beginning to
think Kitty is innocent."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes, she is," said Duane hurriedly,
and still in the same low tone.  "I&mdash;I don't
want her to suffer for something she never did."
</p>

<p>
"The question is," rejoined Salome curtly,
"are you going to own up to all you know?
You've said enough to convince everybody that
you do know something more.  We're all waiting
to hear."
</p>

<p>
The indecision and doubt returned in full to
the girl's face.  "Oh no, not that," she said
quickly.  "I only wanted to stop the accusation
against Kitty, you understand."
</p>

<p>
Salome's lip curled.  "Be a sport, Duane.
Don't keep anything back.  You'll only do
yourself harm.  Honestly, it's your best policy."
</p>

<p>
Duane seemed to shrink a little.  "No, I
tell you I can't do that, Salome.  Look here.
I'm going to cut it."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute."
</p>

<p>
Salome turned round to face the seniors,
from whom an impatient buzz had broken out.
She held up her hand for silence and the noise
subsided, as everybody looked eagerly at her.
</p>

<p>
"Girls, I think the first thing to be settled
is this.  Are you all so positive now that Kitty
is guilty, or are you willing to give her the
benefit of the doubt?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess we're giving it now," called out
Paddy, and it was plain to see that the others
were of the same opinion.  Salome smiled across
at Kitty, who stood rather dazed and white-faced.
"It's all right, Kitty.  You can sleep
to-night with your mind at rest again, I think."
</p>

<p>
The girls swarmed round Kitty, generous
in their apologies and proffers of friendship.
Kitty laughed a little shakily.  "It's all right.
But I'm glad you believe me now.  On my
honour, I've told nothing but the truth."
</p>

<p>
Salome spoke a few hurried words to Vanda,
then turned again and addressed the assembly.
"Duane says she hasn't any more to say
just now, girls.  We'd be awfully obliged if
you'd slip back to your own houses and leave
it to us to settle this affair.  I'll let you know
what&mdash;what we decide, as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
A few more persuasions and the girls, used
to obeying their head prefects, began to file
out of the room, though casting many
disappointed and curious glances at the four who
remained behind.  They thought it rather a
shame that Duane should not be cross-questioned
and made to speak out in their presence.
Still, being a head prefect did make a considerable
difference&mdash;made the affair all the more
serious, too.
</p>

<p>
Salome took the lead, as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it isn't any good staying here and
doing nothing.  What have you got to say
about it, Duane?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to say anything more to-night,
Salome.  I must think it over.  You
must give me to-night to do that."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you realize, Cato," said Vanda
gravely, "exactly what your startling
interruption this evening means to you?  Probably
by to-morrow morning the whole school will
have made up its mind that it was you who
were the culprit."
</p>

<p>
Duane looked at the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I do now.  I didn't realize it at
the time."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I don't suppose you meant to give
yourself away like that.  There are two courses
open to you.  Either you must prove your
innocence or else own up to your guilt&mdash;if you
are guilty."
</p>

<p>
"Prove my innocence?  And how can I
do that, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"You should know best."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, it's plain enough that you know
more about it than anyone else.  You admitted
Kitty didn't do it&mdash;and you had the key.  Look
here, Duane, <i>did</i> you lend it to another girl
whom you don't like to give away?  It's the
only alternative solution I can think of."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Duane impatiently, "or I should
have said so at the inquiry."  Then with a
successful return to her old airy flippancy,
she added, "Well, good night, everybody.  I
really can't be held responsible for all the crazy
conclusions the kids in this school jump to."
</p>

<p>
The three prefects looked at each other as
the door closed upon Duane.
</p>

<p>
"And that's that," said Phyllis Knight.
"Mark my words, Cato's getting her nerve
back again rapidly.  She'll have it all back
by the morning and will choose to brazen it
out.  We shall only get airy nothings for our
pains in future, if I know Cato.  Well, I'm
glad I don't belong to Carslake's.  Good night,
Salome, old girl.  Don't lie awake worrying.
Good night, Van."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE RICHOTER RESULTS
</h3>

<p>
As Salome had foretold, by next morning
public opinion, in its fickle fashion, had
veered completely round and the majority of
the girls were of the opinion that Duane, and
not Kitty, was the culprit.  It seemed to be
a matter more of feeling than cold reasoning,
with many.  It occurred to a Lower Fifth-former
that plasticine was particularly handy in
Duane's case, for lumps of it were always
knocking around the study she shared with
Frances, the artist.  Others agreed that, after
all, the motive for spoiling Salome's results
would be stronger in Duane's case than in
Kitty's, for Duane would benefit personally
and very practically if she succeeded in
triumphing over her most feared opponent.
</p>

<p>
The other prefects were intensely annoyed
by Duane's manner, for the next day she refused
to reopen the discussion at all, declaring that
she had no more to say than what she had
already said.  She refused, their kindly-meant
offers of help, and, in fact, seemed so flippantly
callous in her treatment of the affair that they
left her alone in disgust.
</p>

<p>
But Duane was to find out pretty thoroughly
that the way of transgressors is not an easy path
to tread.  A stiff restraint of manner in the
Upper Fifth classroom was all the condemnation
the seniors would allow themselves to
show; anything in the nature of hooliganism
was "bad form" and derogatory to their
dignity.  They left that to their juniors.
</p>

<p>
The Carslake juniors, however, had no
intention of allowing the matter to drop so
readily, and were far more willing to accept the
belief that Duane, and not Kitty, was guilty
for Kitty had always been more popular with
them than their head prefect.  After their usual
indignation meeting, Duane received a
somewhat smudged sheet of exercise-book paper
requesting her resignation as head prefect of
Carslake's, a request to which she returned a
decided refusal.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter the juniors did all they could in
hundreds of little ways to show their reluctance
to acknowledge her authority, though they did
not dare to rebel outright.  The final inter-house
cricket match had to be scratched at the
last minute because the juniors refused to play
in a team captained by Duane, while from the
cricket committee came a politely worded
request that she should resign her place in the
school eleven.  A few days later, from the
hockey committee came the still politer
intimation that with much regret they felt obliged
to withdraw Duane's hockey colour.  Cricket
was practically over, it is true, but for the next
two terms hockey would reign supreme at Easthampton.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, Duane's own seniors were
not so hard on her as the rest of the school,
France declaring sturdily that she had been
Duane's friend for the last six years and thought
it would be disloyal to allow the recent trouble
to make any difference; Bertha Salter, with a
kind of defiance, was heard to declare that she
even had a sort of admiration for Cato and her
"nerve"; while kind-hearted Margaret could
not refrain from proffering her sympathy to
Duane for the loss of her hockey colour.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm afraid I shan't be able to show
my shining genius at hockey next term by
scoring all the goals for the school," Duane
agreed, rather cheerfully than otherwise.
"However, I console myself with the thought
that the school matches are not the only ones
played."
</p>

<p>
At first the other three head prefects
wondered if they should go further in the
matter.  They could do no more themselves
if Duane continued obdurate.  Should they or
should they not take this new development to
the Principal?  But there were other even more
important matters to engross their attention
now.  Examinations had begun.  The Upper
Fifth were in the throes of the Senior
Cambridge, the Sixth departed "en bloc" to London
for a week, to sit for matriculation, while even
the juniors had their own class examinations
to occupy their minds.
</p>

<p>
These were just finished when the Principal
received the results of the Richoter exam and
summoned the school together in the hall just
after preparation to announce them publicly.
Intense, if subdued, excitement prevailed when
Miss St. Leger entered and took her stand on
the dais.
</p>

<p>
After a few opening remarks on the Richoter
itself, explaining what it was and that a yearly
grant was awarded to the winner as well as the
honour gained in securing top marks, she went
on, "And now for the results themselves, which
are very creditable.  Miss Vacher and I were
aware that two girls specially had particular
talent for this branch of work; we thought
these two stood the best chance of gaining most
marks, but we were very curious as to which
it would be.  These girls, I may say, have run
each other very close, heading the list with only
a difference of two marks.  Here are the marks
of the leading five, out of a possible total of 300:
</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-left: 10%">
  Duane Estevan &nbsp;&nbsp;247<br>
  Constance Hope &nbsp;&nbsp;245<br>
  Eileen Gilbert &nbsp;&nbsp;239<br>
  Grace Felton &nbsp;&nbsp;225<br>
  Florence Lessingham &nbsp;&nbsp;201<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"So you see that Duane has just beaten
Constance by a very slender margin, and with
an excellent total of 247."
</p>

<p>
The Principal paused, naturally, for the
clamorous applause that should follow her
announcement.
</p>

<p>
But there was no applause.
</p>

<p>
Instead, there was a dead silence that seemed
to last for an eternity.  "The most ghastly
silence she had ever heard," Paddy afterwards
remarked with one of her unexpected Irishisms.
No one moved or spoke, but all seemed to be
staring straight ahead with wooden countenances.
One or two stole a glance at the Carslake
head prefect.  She stood in her place, her
gaze fixed on the floor, her lips set tightly
together.  Salome was crimson, knowing full well
that had her own name been read at the head
of the list it would have been the signal for a
deafening outburst of applause.
</p>

<p>
On the Principal's face dawned a look of
astonishment as she waited for the applause
which never came.  Miss Sheerston's brows went
up about half an inch, and the other members
of the staff shifted uncomfortably in their chairs.
Miss Carslake, who had entered beaming all
over her face, looked alarmed and her smile
gradually faded away.  Then the Principal's
face became expressionless and she went on in
a matter-of-fact tone, as if nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
"The other five candidates have all succeeded
in gaining over half marks.  I will read
them out," and the tension relaxed with an
audible sigh of relief from the rows of listening
girls.
</p>

<p>
At the order for dismissal everyone filed off
back to the houses.  Salome wanted to seek
out the winner and offer her congratulations,
but somehow felt that such a course was now
impossible.  It would seem such a farcical
proceeding after that dreadful silence in the hall.
She felt still more uncomfortable when one of
her own seniors said to her, "Hard luck,
Salome!  Duane Estevan ought to have been
disqualified for her sneaking attempt at cheating."
</p>

<p>
Salome checked such remarks as well as she
could, pointing out that, whether Duane had
attempted to spoil her experiment or not, her
own work must have been the best or she
would not have gained the highest total.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's clever enough.  We all know
that," remarked one Upper Fifth-former rather
bitterly.  "In fact, she's a bit too clever
sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Duane had returned to her own
house with the Carslake seniors in an
uncomfortable silence.  She herself uttered no words
and the others did not know what to say.  The
climax came when they entered the common-room.
The girls were standing about in idle
groups, though the supper bell had gone.  The
head prefect spoke as she passed through.
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't be standing about like this,
you know.  You ought to be in the dining-room.
The bell has gone."
</p>

<p>
Everybody stopped talking and looked up.
No one moved, however; then someone hissed
deliberately and one or two laughed sneeringly.
Duane bit her lip and the colour ran up under
her skin.  For a moment she stood irresolute,
then turned and walked off.  The rest of the
girls went in to supper, but the head prefect's
place was vacant.  After supper the seniors
drifted upstairs together into Hilary's study
where they conversed desultorily on the
holidays, now very near.  In a few minutes
Duane appeared and sauntered into the room.
The six girls looked up uncomfortably.  It was
Duane who spoke first, with a drawl that was
more than usually pronounced.
</p>

<p>
"I've just given in to Miss Carslake my
resignation of the head prefectship."
</p>

<p>
"You've resigned, Duane?" stammered
Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"No, you haven't really!" cried France.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have.  What else could I do?
As matters are, it's a mere farce my being
head prefect."
</p>

<p>
This was true enough.  No one, indeed,
could gainsay it.
</p>

<p>
"What did Miss Carslake say?" inquired
Hilary.
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  I think this evening enlightened
her somewhat as to the state of affairs.
She will leave it to the Principal to settle, of
course."
</p>

<p>
Miss Carslake, much disturbed, went straight
to Miss St. Leger.  The Principal sent for Duane
late that evening, and it was some time after
bed bell when the prefect came up to her
cubicle, though exactly what passed between
them in that interview no one but the two
concerned ever knew.  Next morning after
chapel, when just about to set out for morning
lessons, the Carslake seniors received orders
to go to the Principal's room.  They found
Salome, Vanda and Phyllis already there.  The
Principal, as was her wont, went straight to
the point.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you know, girls, that Duane
told Miss Carslake last night that she wished
to resign her prefectship, giving as her reasons
her unpopularity in the school, in particular
among her own juniors, who seem to resent
very much having to submit to her authority.
She feels that under these circumstances she
cannot properly discharge her duties as head
prefect.  Miss Carslake informs me that there
was some feeling in the house against the
prefects at the beginning of the term, chiefly owing
to the suppression of rival societies amongst
the juniors, societies which were doing them
no good.  This, I understand, however, was
only a temporary phase and would doubtless
have blown over in time&mdash;was in fact nearly
forgotten&mdash;when the unfortunate incident in
connexion with the Richoter exam occurred.
I am right in saying, am I not, that the school
as a whole has made up its mind to lay the
blame on Duane?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is true, Miss St. Leger," replied
Salome, speaking for them all.
</p>

<p>
"I have been very much occupied with
examinations lately," continued the Principal,
"and hardly realized Duane's unpopularity and
the reason for it, until yesterday evening in the
hall.  But, as far as I can make out, there are
no further proofs of either Duane's or Kitty's
guilt than those we discussed at the inquiry."
</p>

<p>
Salome tried to explain.  "You see, feeling
was at first against Kitty; then something
Duane said&mdash;her attitude&mdash;I mean her manner,
convinced the school that she, and not Kitty,
was the one responsible."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes.  I have heard about that too.
The girls believe Duane was on the point of
making a confession, but drew back from doing
so.  I questioned Duane herself about it last
night, but she assured me she had never intended
making a confession at any time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe she says that," assented
Salome quietly.  The others said nothing,
realizing the futility of trying to explain
satisfactorily what actually had happened on the
evening of Paddy's mock trial.
</p>

<p>
"It appears, then, that it is a matter of
'feeling' in the school, rather than of actual
proof.  For my part, I still cannot see how
one girl can be adjudged guilty any more than
the other.  Either <i>might</i> have done it; we
cannot definitely prove that either <i>did</i> do it.
It was because of this doubt in the matter, and
also because both girls bore an unblemished
record in the school, that I decided to let the
matter rest.  You know, girls, one should be
very certain of guilt, before proceeding to inflict
punishment."
</p>

<p>
"We have tried to be quite fair, Miss St. Leger,"
said Vanda gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know that."  Miss St. Leger
smiled.  "There isn't much I don't know about
the characters of the girls in my school, believe
me.  But I wish you had spoken to me of this
exceedingly strong tide of feeling in the school
before, instead of taking the easier course and
doing nothing.  However, now I do know, I
will tell you my decision.  I have refused to
accept Duane's resignation because, for the two
reasons I have just given you, I do not see that
there is sufficient justification for it.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to realize this also.  In taking
on the head prefectship in the third term of a
school year and also in a house where the
juniors had already shown themselves to be a
particularly unruly and unbalanced set as a
whole, Duane was accepting a far from easy
task.  I don't think you girls understood quite
how difficult her position was."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, we knew it was not an easy one,"
said Hilary earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Then some allowances must be made for
mistakes, for failures now and again.  For one
thing, it was an unprecedented happening for
a Fifth-former to become head prefect&mdash;to be
head and yet not the equal of the other head
prefects.  Again, there was an unfortunately
large majority of juniors over seniors in
Carslake's.  I am confident, however, that there will
be a great improvement after the holidays.  The
older juniors will be seniors and will realize the
responsibility of their position more readily.  I
am hoping that much of this unpleasantness will
be buried and put out of mind during the
summer vacation.  I would prefer, if the culprit
cannot be discovered so as to settle the matter
beyond all doubt, that the affair should be
forgotten, or at any rate, laid entirely on one side.
I am hoping, also, that Duane will have
sufficient strength of character to live down this
feeling in the school against her.  You,"
addressing the Carslake seniors, "will, I hope,
back up your head prefect as much as you can."
</p>

<p>
"We have always done that, Miss St. Leger,"
replied Hilary.  "It isn't through us
that Duane sent in her resignation.  But
supposing the juniors still refuse to acknowledge
Duane's authority?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think they will do that, with my
authority behind the head prefect's.  In fact,
I shall see to it that they do not.  I will speak
to them about it, if necessary, but I think
things will work more smoothly after the
holidays.  That is all I have to say to you just
now, girls.  I know I can rely on you always
to do what you can to help."
</p>

<p>
That term at Easthampton, however, was
destined to end in a manner befitting the rest
of its troubled course.  The day after the
intervention of the Principal the baby of Dormitory
A, little Erica Salter, was taken to the
sanatorium with a high temperature, her illness
being later diagnosed as a severe attack of
'flu.  Hilary was the next one to fall a victim,
and when, before the week was out, half a
dozen girls in Carslake's and as many in the
other houses joined them, Miss St. Leger decided
that the best plan would be to close the school
before the epidemic grew worse; in any case,
it would only shorten the term by a bare week,
and as examinations were over, the only event
that was left was the Sports Day, and that
she decided to postpone till early in the next
term.
</p>

<p>
Great was the jubilation in the school when
it was announced that girls might communicate
with their people and leave for the summer
vacation as soon as they could make arrangements
to do so.  All thoughts of lessons were
abandoned and everyone commenced to pack
feverishly.  The dormitories and the vestibule
presented a scene as animated and busy as a
London terminus on August Bank Holiday.
</p>

<p>
"Never seen it done so quickly," remarked
France.  "Most new kids commence packing
at least a week before breaking-up day.  I
remember my first vacation, like all new girls,
I was so frightened I shouldn't get packed in
time that I started three days beforehand.
That night, after bed bell had rung I discovered
I had packed <i>all</i> my nightdresses in the bottom
of my trunk, which was downstairs already
locked and corded.  I was never in such a
hurry to pack after that."
</p>

<p>
It was astonishing how quickly the school
seemed to empty as party after party, some
walking, some in taxis, set off for the station
to catch their trains.  The mistresses were busy
taking the juniors to the station and seeing
them safely off, or delivering them into the
charge of the older girls.  Kitty, who was
spending the holiday with the Wades, departed
with France and Margaret.  At last, a strange
silence settled over the school which had such
a short time ago buzzed with life.  The summer
vacation had begun.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
SPORTS DAY
</h3>

<p>
Sports Day had come and gone.  Carslake's
was feeling extremely pleased with
itself, not to say jubilant; at last the house
had distinguished itself.  Perhaps the girls
realized it really was time they "bucked up";
perhaps Fortune, for once, was on their side.
Certainly they had done better than they had
hoped for, and when the points were totalled
up Easthampton stared in amazement.
</p>

<p>
When the new term began, there were
some changes in the school, as was only natural.
For one thing, most girls had moved up a form;
this was specially noticeable in Carslake's, where
the majority of the turbulent Fourth had
attained the dignity of seniors.  That change,
at least, was decidedly one for the better.  Of
course, some of the old familiar faces were gone.
Phyllis Knight had left and Green's had a new
head prefect.  Prince's mourned the loss of
Eileen Gilbert and others of the Sixth, but
everybody was glad to see both Salome and
Vanda return and resume their old positions.
They had matriculated well, but&mdash;as they both
intended taking a university course and were
barely eighteen&mdash;they had come back to study
for a university scholarship, for which there
was a special class at Easthampton.
</p>

<p>
Kitty had been very pleased to hear that
she had succeeded in passing the Senior
Cambridge, having been rather doubtful of
success.  Hilary had taken a Second Class,
Duane a Third, while France and Kitty had
each achieved a pass.  The four girls were
now Sixth-formers, their successes having
entitled them to their remove, while Kitty had
been exalted to the rank of prefect.  She felt
herself to be quite an important personage now.
</p>

<p>
Hilary unfortunately had not returned.  She
had had a relapse after reaching home, and
her people had sent her away for a long holiday.
But she wrote to her form companions in a
cheerful spirit, saying she hoped to be back
amongst them before very long, prepared for
more hard work.
</p>

<p>
Hilary's absence made quite an important
difference in the relations of the new Sixth at
Carslake's&mdash;but that shall be explained later.
It would not be right to pass over Sports Day
without entering into the details of some of
the Carslake triumphs.
</p>

<p>
They had made a good beginning in the
high jump.  Salome was the winner, beating
the school record with a jump of 4 feet 6 inches,
but Kitty gained a very valuable two points
in securing second place.  The obstacle race
had fallen to Paddy, and Carslake's did not
win a point, nor in the tortoise race that
followed.  But Peggy O'Nell won the junior
100 yards in brilliant style, and Daisy Carteret
was second in the junior 220 yards.  The first
and second places in throwing the cricket ball
were secured by Prince's and Green's respectively,
but Bertha was a close third with a good throw.
</p>

<p>
When the senior flat race finals began,
interest increased.  The half-mile had fewest
entries, for it was naturally regarded as the
stiffest.  In this, the final, there were only
four competitors, two from Prince's, one from
Sheerston's and one from Carslake's.  Each
house shouted encouragement to its own
runners.  Vanda West was generally reckoned
to be the most likely winner, though several
hockey colours declared that Duane might
"pull it off."
</p>

<p>
"You know," one of them declared as they
lined up, "she can get down the field before
you can look round, when she's on the ball
and there's a chance for a shot at goal."
</p>

<p>
"You're right," said Gwen Parker, the
former school right wing, who had returned
with several others to compete for her house,
Sports Day being officially a last year's event.
"I've found myself with all my work cut out
to keep up with her when she gets on the move
in a match."
</p>

<p>
"Still, Vanda can <i>stay</i>, and that's what
counts in the half-mile."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, or else I should have had a shot at
it," replied Gwen.
</p>

<p>
Then somebody shouted: "Mind you don't
go to sleep in the middle, Cato, thinking it's
bedtime!"  And that fetched a general laugh.
</p>

<p>
The next minute the four were off, running
with steady strides, Vanda and Duane side
by side and a few paces behind the other two.
At the end of the second lap the two rash ones
who had rushed ahead at the beginning had
dropped behind, panting and breathless.  Now
Vanda and Duane were in front, running neck
and neck.  The pace was already fast but
Eileen increased it, hoping to gain the lead,
and as they entered the last lap, Vanda leading
but Duane refusing to drop behind by more
than a yard, the yells of the Prince's girls
increased in volume.  The excitement was
intense.  Even France, who was wont to declaim
emphatically that she had no patience with these
"races and things," hopped wildly about at
Kitty's side and yelled to Duane as she passed:
</p>

<p>
"Go it!  Remember the match against
Winthorpe last year!"
</p>

<p>
The critical moment had come.  Duane
quickened her long strides with a scarcely
perceptible effort, drew ahead of Vanda, and passed
her, despite her attempt at a spurt, increasing
her lead all down the last half-lap, "running,"
so France declared excitedly, "just as if it
were the hundred yards' sprint."
</p>

<p>
Kitty cheered with the rest, and as Duane,
breathing hurriedly but otherwise looking the
same as usual, strolled up in her leisurely fashion
with her hands in her blazer pockets, she said
impulsively, "By Jove! you can run, then, Duane."
</p>

<p>
Duane's glance met Kitty's quizzically.
"Really think so?" she drawled.  "Have I
at last won a word of praise from you?  I
can hardly express my overpowering emotion."
</p>

<p>
Kitty's face flamed, and she fell back a
step, feeling as if the other girl had slapped
her in the face.  "It was horrid of her to say
that," she thought to herself, feeling hurt and
resentful.  "I really did mean it quite
sincerely."  Duane, meanwhile, went on after a
short pause, "It's your turn next.  Now show
them that I'm not the only gifted one."
</p>

<p>
Kitty looked straight at her just for a
moment and her eyes sparkled.  "I'm going to,"
she snapped, and turned away, vowing that
she would win the quarter-mile or die in the
attempt.  Strange to say, for once Kitty was
not thinking of the honour of Carslake's; as
she lined up for the race with lips set
determinedly, the house was not even in her mind,
only the house's head prefect.
</p>

<p>
The faces of the Carslake girls became even
more seraphic when Kitty won the quarter-mile,
by a bare half-yard.  After that there was a
short interval.  The afternoon was drawing to
an end, and only two events remained to be
contested.  The excitement mounted when the
girls who were keeping account of the points
scored, announced that Sheerston's was leading,
with despised Carslake's only one point behind.
</p>

<p>
"We must win one of these last two," said
Kitty desperately.  "Another first would
probably do it."
</p>

<p>
But in the relay race, their luck deserted
them.  All three girls ran well, but Peggy, who
was shaking with nervous excitement, muffed
taking the flag from Duane and lost a valuable
three or four seconds and the start Duane had
given her.  Both she and Kitty made a
desperate attempt to overtake the leader, but
found it beyond their powers, and finished third.
They were now two points behind Sheerston's,
who had finished second.
</p>

<p>
There was still the 100 yards to be run.
The unhappy Frances, who was Carslake's sole
representative, found herself overwhelmed with
exhortations, advice and admonitions.
</p>

<p>
"It rests with you now, France," said
Duane.  "Mind you run for all you're worth."  France
groaned.  "For goodness' sake stop that.
I wish I'd never entered for the wretched
thing.  You put my name down, Duane, and
you must be responsible for the consequences.
I don't pretend to be able to run races.  I'm
not an athlete, I'm an artist."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what you are," said Duane.
"Just pull up your stockings and run.  I know
you can sprint a bit, for I've seen you dash
across the quad when you've been a bit late
for class.  Imagine someone in front is running
off with your most prized picture.  Cheer up!
It's only a hundred yards, so it won't kill you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pose for you if you'll do your very best,"
urged Kitty.  "Next Wednesday afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"No," replied France, with a funny air of
dignity.  "I don't want any bribes.  Though
I've entered for this race under protest, I'll
run my very hardest," and she nodded her head
determinedly.
</p>

<p>
France took her place with a painful expression
on her face.  "Looks as if she were going to have
a tooth out, doesn't she!" whispered Peggy O'Nell
to her right-hand neighbour, with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
The flag fell.  For a few breathless seconds
there was nothing to be seen but a flash of
black-clad legs, then the runners threw
themselves headlong at the tape and burst beyond
it.  There was scarcely an inch between the
first three girls, or so it seemed to the watchers,
but the judges gave out the results; France
first, Gwen Parker second and Paddy third.
Carslake's had gained three points and
Sheerston's one; and the day ended in Sheerston's
and Carslake's tying for first place.
</p>

<p>
So, strange to say, it was France who was
the hero of the occasion.  She found it decidedly
a pleasant sensation, and began to plume herself
complacently, remarking in a confidential tone
to the other seniors: "You know, I always
did rather fancy myself as a winger at hockey,
if only it weren't such a waste of time using all
one's spare minutes just to play a game."
</p>

<p>
"And that's where you're going to play in
future," said Duane firmly.  "A girl who can
sprint like you can is wasted anywhere else.
We'll make it a fair bargain.  You come to
practices regularly and we'll pose for your
blessed Academy pictures, or National Gallery
portraits, whichever it happens to be.  I'll
even," she ended, in a burst of generosity,
"come now and again and blow your organ
for you when Orpheus is indisposed."
</p>

<p>
France eyed her study-companion reflectively.
"If you can summon up enough energy
to come and blow the organ, I'll play in all the
house matches; so there," she declared.
</p>

<p>
The results of Sports Day had certainly
improved matters at Carslake's.  There was no
open rebellion against the head prefect's rule,
though now and again there were little
unpleasant moments which showed that the house
would never quite forget the fact that their
head prefect's reputation had a deep and
ineradicable stain on it.  There was not the same
cheerful alacrity displayed in obeying Duane's
wishes as in obeying those of the other
Sixth-formers; obedience was shown, but it was a
grudging obedience and would probably never
be anything different.
</p>

<p>
The following evening Duane was alone in
her study, seated in her favourite attitude&mdash;that
is to say, leaning in the depths of an easy-chair
with her feet across another chair&mdash;when
Kitty entered.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  What is it?" inquired Duane,
looking up from her book.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I'm not disturbing you," said Kitty,
politely.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I'm only finishing off that
wretched paraphrasing set us for prep.  Couldn't
get it done before."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause till Kitty recollected
she had not yet explained the reason for her
visit.  "Oh, by the way, France told me you
had something to say to me.  That's why I
looked in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see.  It's nothing of much importance.
Any time would have done.  I thought,
until Hilary returns, you might as well dig in
here with France and me.  It's lonely having
a room all on your own."
</p>

<p>
Kitty flushed in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I don't mind that.  I don't want
to cause you any inconvenience."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  There's heaps of room for
three here, if we clear some of France's litter."
</p>

<p>
Kitty looked uncomfortable.  "Was it you
or France who thought of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Does it matter who thought of it?"
returned Duane, carelessly.
</p>

<p>
Kitty was silent again, feeling still more
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks all the same," she said, at last,
"but I don't think I will."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"  Duane, not unnaturally,
wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
Kitty felt herself turning crimson and blurted
out, "Well, you see, it might be rather awkward."
</p>

<p>
"Awkward?  How?"
</p>

<p>
"What I mean is that you and I aren't
exactly friends."
</p>

<p>
Duane lifted her glance now, and kept it
fixed on Kitty, but merely remarked coolly:
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we?"
</p>

<p>
"You know we are not," replied Kitty, a
little impatiently.  "We never have been.  We
felt&mdash;felt antagonistic the very first moment
we met each other."
</p>

<p>
"You did, I suppose," rejoined Duane.  "I
don't know that I felt anything at all.
However, that's no reason why we need go on being
antagonistic, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" demanded Kitty, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
Duane leaned back in her chair and smiled
lazily at Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't we be friends now?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty flushed again, and moved uneasily,
her agony of embarrassment mounting.  Duane
tilted her chair back and went on cheerfully:
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem in a hurry to speak.
After all, there's no reason why we shouldn't
be friends, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," Kitty blurted out.  "I'd
rather not.  You see&mdash;&mdash;" she stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Out with it!"
</p>

<p>
"It's the Richoter," poor Kitty went on,
growing hotter and hotter, and angry with
herself for feeling so uncomfortable under
Duane's lazy, quizzical glance.  "I&mdash;you see&mdash;I
couldn't be friends with&mdash;with anyone who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's it, is it?" said Duane.
"You're mighty particular."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to seem a prig.  If it had been
anything else&mdash;but&mdash;but that kind of thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then, the Richoter affair aside, your only
prejudice to admitting me to your&mdash;your circle
of friends, would be gone?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," replied Kitty, frankly.
"You can't <i>make</i> yourself be friends with
anyone, you know.  At any rate, I don't think
so.  We're so utterly unlike, aren't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Are we?  Then do you think that people
must be alike to be friends?"
</p>

<p>
"They must have tastes in common,"
replied Kitty, firmly.  "At least, so it has
always seemed to me."
</p>

<p>
"Why not give it a trial?" suggested Duane.
</p>

<p>
Kitty stood irresolute, conscious that in
some curious indefinable way she was attracted
by the other girl's proposal and yet repelled
at the same time.  The affair was settled by
the abrupt entrance of France.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hallo, Kitty!  I suppose Duane's told
you about digging in with us till Hilary returns?
What's that?  Doesn't want to?  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"She says we're antagonistic," replied Duane.
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense!" said France, very firmly.
"What on earth does she mean?  You bring
your things along, Kitty, and I'm sure we shall
enjoy each other's company while we're here,"
and Kitty rather reluctantly gave way.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
CARSLAKE'S v. THE REST
</h3>

<p>
France stepped back and surveyed her
plasticine model of Duane's profile with
an air of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"I say, girls," she remarked, conversationally,
"I really think Carslake's is being treated
with due respect at last.  I don't think the
other houses have yet recovered from the shock
we gave them on Sports Day."
</p>

<p>
Kitty looked up from her book, as if relieved
to find an excuse for so doing.  "If only we
can keep our new reputation," she said
seriously.  "We mustn't get slack again."
</p>

<p>
"We must give them another shock," said
Duane, sleepily.  "A real startler this time.
I'll think something out."  She yawned with
a muffled, "Goodness, how sleepy a fire makes
one!" and silence settled down again in the
study.  A little later, however, there was a
message from Miss Carslake, "Would Duane
please bring along her weekly report.  It should
have been brought earlier in the evening."  This
report was a record of lines or punishments
of that description imposed by any of
the prefects during the week.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang!" exclaimed Miss Carslake's
disgusted head prefect.  "She was out when I
went before, and of course she must start
bothering when I'm comfortably settled down.
D'you think I might send the book along for
once without going myself?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't advise you to," replied Kitty,
in a discouraging tone.  "I don't suppose for a
minute that would satisfy Miss Carslake."
</p>

<p>
"Cut along and get it over," advised France,
grinning.  "It won't take very long."
</p>

<p>
With much grumbling the head prefect
lowered her long legs to the ground, pulled
herself up and took her departure.  When she
returned a little later it was in the company
of the other three Sixth-formers, and there was
an unusual air of animation about her.
</p>

<p>
"I say, girls, an idea!" she announced,
when they were all inside.  "Why not take
a leaf out of Kitty's book!  I suggest challenging
the rest of the school to a hockey match&mdash;Top
House v. the Rest."
</p>

<p>
"That practically means," said Margaret,
judicially, "Carslake's against the school first
eleven.  It sounds quite mad to me.  What
do you say, Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I certainly agree with Duane that
it would cause a sensation in the school," replied
Kitty, shrewdly.  "However, the weak point
in the idea, as far as I can see, is that we shall
get such a licking that we shan't be able to
lift up our heads again."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why we should," from Duane.
</p>

<p>
"But you don't really think we should stand
the slightest chance against the school eleven?"
protested Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, Bertha," remonstrated Duane,
"you and Kitty, of all people, to be so
faint-hearted over a hockey match when both of
you are practically certain of getting your
hockey colours before the end of the season!"
</p>

<p>
"But three can't beat eleven."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not proposing they should.  Leave
it to me to get up an eleven.  This house has
been so used to holding humble opinions about
itself that it can't get out of the habit.  You
forget one or two things: that there are
sixteen seniors now, where last year there were
only six; as that quite half of the old school
eleven left last term and there will have to be
a big proportion of new colours in it.  I will
guarantee to get quite a respectable line of
forwards from our Lower Fifth, if we older
ones can manage the defence."
</p>

<p>
"And supposing they refuse to accept our
challenge, as being beneath their dignity?"
said Sonia.
</p>

<p>
"They won't do that.  We should be able
to say they were afraid to accept it.  A
challenge is a challenge."
</p>

<p>
Silence, while everybody looked at each other.
"Well, what about it?" asked Duane.  "Will
you do it or not, if the Lower Fifth are willing?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty was the first to respond.
</p>

<p>
"I'm on," she said, impulsively.  "Though
I believe we haven't the slightest chance of
winning.  All the same, the idea's a gorgeous
one and for pure cheek takes the biscuit.  I
wish I'd thought of it myself."
</p>

<p>
Carslake's hockey challenge certainly did
cause a sensation in the school.  Some girls
treated it with ridicule, a few were angry, all
agreed that it was awful cheek on the part of
the much-despised Carslake's.  The challenge
was accepted, however, with the firm resolution
that the challengers should be punished for
their cheek by such a beating as had never
yet been seen on the school playing-fields.
Carslake's tried to assume a careless, confident,
nonchalant air, but the only one of them who
really succeeded was their head prefect and that
because the pose was a natural one.  Inwardly
they were all quaking at their temerity, even
such bold spirits as Kitty and Peggy O'Nell,
and looking forward to the match with feelings
of apprehension.
</p>

<p>
Duane, with an undue amount of deliberation,
had drawn up her team.  "I've put
Bertha and Edith in their usual positions at
right back and goal," she explained.  "Kitty,
I want you to be the other back.
Halves&mdash;Margaret, myself, Mary.  Forwards,
wings&mdash;France and Peggy.  Yes, France, you must
play, and what's more you'll have to run as
you've never run in your life before, not even
on Sports Day."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it," said France heroically, "for the
honour of the house.  Even if it means dropping
dead half-way through the match."
</p>

<p>
"Dropping dead!  Rubbish!" returned
Duane, with unusual energy for her.  "Daisy,
you must take centre-forward.  I'll help you
all I can.  Inners&mdash;Barbara and Rosalie.
That's the best we can do, I think!"
</p>

<p>
The match was fixed for Wednesday, and
the Carslake girls practised diligently in their
team positions whenever they had the chance.
Kitty enjoyed these practices immensely and
played left-back with great vigour&mdash;perhaps,
sometimes, with more vigour than skill.
Duane's attitude towards these practices amused
her very much.  She did not play herself, but,
wrapped in her coat with its high fur collar,
stood by the side of the ground, leaning
gracefully upon her stick and giving advice and
criticism on the play by means of a remarkable
flow of cutting remarks, directed chiefly against
the forwards and halves.  According to her,
they were slow and hesitating, they used neither
their sticks nor their feet properly, their
shooting was miserably feeble and their passing most
inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, Kitty reflected, Duane certainly
seemed to know all there was to know about
the theoretical side of hockey.  She also seemed
to have the knack of surprising everyone by
pulling off the most unexpected things, in an
almost accidental kind of way.  Kitty was
astonished that she did not feel so much
annoyed and irritated&mdash;as she certainly would
have done three months ago&mdash;as quietly amused.
She put it down to the fact that she was getting
used to Duane and her ways.
</p>

<p>
She found that Bertha was quite a reliable
partner to have at right back; she was sturdily
built, and, if inclined to be a trifle slow against
quick forwards, she stuck to them like a leech.
She was a queer, reserved girl with little to
say for herself; Kitty divined that there was
a certain streak of sullen obstinacy in her
character.
</p>

<p>
The day of the match came at last.  Everybody
seemed unusually restless during afternoon
lessons, and as soon as dismissal bell rang there
was a general stampede for the playing-fields.
</p>

<p>
The Carslake eleven gathered in a little
group inside one room in the pavilion.  "Oh
dear," sighed Peggy, "I feel most frightfully
squirmy inside.  For mercy's sake, Edie, don't
let any shots through."
</p>

<p>
"Can't help it sometimes," mumbled Edie,
wriggling nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look so glum, everybody!" cried
Kitty, looking around.  "We're not beaten yet,
you know."
</p>

<p>
The youngest members of the team brightened
up at this, for there certainly was something
cheering in the sight of Kitty, looking so
vigorous and dependable.  Kitty glanced
curiously round at their captain.  That worthy
stood in her favourite attitude&mdash;viz. leaning
gracefully on her stick, a well-worn weapon with
a heavy crook, guard and rubber-bound handle.
She, too, was quite a striking figure in her
perfectly fitting tunic ending well above her knees,
as unperturbed as ever.  "Time we were on
the field," she said.  "Just remember this,
please.  Whatever happens, you forwards are to
keep forward."
</p>

<p>
"Here, Duane," remonstrated France.
"You're not going to play with that watch
on, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Watch?" said Duane, vaguely.  "Oh&mdash;er&mdash;no,
of course not.  I quite forgot it.  Here,
mind it for me, one of you kids."
</p>

<p>
"You've got shoes on too," struck in
Margaret, reprovingly.  "I thought Miss Bryce
said nobody was to play matches in shoes
unless she had pads on."
</p>

<p>
"Can't help it if she did.  I never could
play in boots&mdash;can't run.  Don't worry, Margaret.
I'll look out for my shins if you'll look
after yours."
</p>

<p>
They all scrambled out of the pavilion and
the two teams lined up on the field.  The school
eleven certainly looked a stiff lot to tackle,
for Easthampton boasted of one of the best
ladies' elevens in the county.  The centre-forwards
bullied off and for the first twenty minutes
both sides continued to strain every nerve to
keep up the pressure.  The wise prognosticated
that the pace could not last; the weaker side
would not be able to keep it going.
</p>

<p>
On the wings France and Peggy, as fast
as their opponents, were always dangerous and
several times carried the ball right to the goal
circle, but could not break through the school
defence.  Carslake's, too, was defending
gallantly against a dashing forward line.  Duane
in the centre held Paddy and her two inners
in check, and more than one of the onlookers
remarked, "Cato's playing a good game to-day."
</p>

<p>
The Carslake captain had quite a distinctive
style.  She never appeared flurried, and, for
hockey, was even unhurried.  She played with
neat adroitness, using both stick and feet with
remarkable dexterity, invariably successful in
robbing the attacker of the ball just at the
right moment and hitting away without pause,
as hard and accurate as a machine.  The danger
came from the wings, for the Carslake
half-backs were comparatively weak and too slow
to hold the school forwards.  Kitty and Bertha
found their work cut out for them in that
quarter, while, by a tacit understanding, Duane
held the centre.
</p>

<p>
But the pace was bound to tell.  The end
of the first twenty minutes found the lighter
side being slowly overwhelmed and pressed back.
The forwards made their attacking dashes at
longer and still longer intervals, while the halves
were back with Kitty and Bertha, resisting
desperately.  Twice Edith saved, but the school
were not to be denied.  A furious attack swept
the ball over the goal line, then the left wing
broke through, and when half-time sounded the
school were leading by two goals to nil.
</p>

<p>
The Carslake team walked off the field and
into the pavilion, looking tired and dispirited,
with the feeling that worse things were in store
for them in the second half.  Public opinion
was the same, for it was obvious that Carslake's
were tired out and worn down by the pace,
while the school felt as fresh as ever when they
thought of the lead they had gained over their
opponents.
</p>

<p>
"If it weren't just for a few&mdash;Duane, Kitty
and Bertha," remarked one of the team, "we'd
be all over them, and they wouldn't have a
look in.  Those three are as hard as nails, I
know, but even they won't be able to keep us
out much longer.  It'll be a walk-over next half."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the pavilion, the younger
members of the Carslake team dropped down
wearily upon the nearest seats.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear," gasped Daisy, "I feel nearly
dead-beat."
</p>

<p>
"And I've got the stitch," added France,
dismally, for the artist, good though her
intentions might be, was not in the form to stand
a gruelling match like this.
</p>

<p>
When Duane entered everybody seemed to
glance spontaneously towards her, as the central
figure in the whole affair.  After all, it was she
who was responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
She stood looking at them for a moment
in silence.  Her pale, rather sallow-complexioned
face was flushed, her hair for once was ruffled
and untidy; her light grey eyes shone vividly
in their dark setting.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" she greeted them.  "What are
you all looking so dismal about?"
</p>

<p>
"We're not looking dismal exactly," protested
Peggy, "but&mdash;well&mdash;they'll walk over
us in the second half, Duane."
</p>

<p>
"And why on earth," demanded Duane,
"should they walk over us?"
</p>

<p>
"We're dead-beat.  I feel as if I couldn't
run another step," with a weary sigh.  "I
simply couldn't get past those backs."
</p>

<p>
"And I've got the stitch," added France,
lugubriously.
</p>

<p>
"And my heel rubs."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, if you're going to lie down
on the grass and <i>let 'em</i>," said Duane slowly
and with supreme scorn, "I've no doubt they
<i>will</i> walk over you."
</p>

<p>
Peggy flushed.  "Of course, we'll do our best.
But all the same, it was ridiculous to think we
could do anything against the school eleven."
</p>

<p>
"Well, naturally," said Duane, sharply, "if
you're giving in like this, it is hopeless.  Only
please realize that the match isn't over, so we
haven't lost yet.  I haven't been accustomed to
playing in a team that sits down half-way
through a match and says it's beaten.  I, for
one, certainly don't admit it, and I'm going on
playing and sticking to it while I've a breath
in me, if I'm the only one in the team left on
the field.  You stick to me and I'll stick to you.
I will, on my honour, and what's more, I'll see
you through somehow."
</p>

<p>
The last words came out in a rush.  The
girl was still facing them, the blaze of an
unconquered spirit lighting her brilliant eyes.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, nobody stirred or spoke.
Then Kitty jumped to her feet, and crossed
over to the head prefect's side.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sticking to you, Duane," she exclaimed,
clearly, driven by an impulse she did not stop
to analyse.  "There'll be two to play on to
the end, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"And so am I," in Bertha's more deliberate tones.
</p>

<p>
"And I."  France, too, sprang impetuously
to her feet.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of the leader was as infectious as
a disease.  Everyone was on her feet now,
eager and enthusiastic.  It was as if a flame
had suddenly been lit, spreading like a flash
from one to the other.  It was a different
team entirely from the one that had entered
the pavilion a few minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
Duane surveyed them a moment in silence.
"That's better," she said, quietly.  "I guess, if
you're not very big, you're game anyway."
</p>

<p>
"There's the whistle," cried somebody, and
the forwards ran out laughing and talking.
The bigger girls followed more decorously.
Duane laid her hand lightly on Kitty's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Kitty," she said, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"What for?" said Kitty, awkward and
embarrassed.  "For backing you up?  And what else
should I do?  You're the captain of this team."
</p>

<p>
The game began again after much the same
fashion as in the first half.  The school eleven,
who had expected to find their work much
easier now, were astonished to discover that
their opponents were playing with a new burst
of energy and enthusiasm, sticking to it
determinedly.  The spectators, too, were surprised,
and generously conceded that if Carslake's had
rather too much cheek, their hockey eleven
certainly had plenty of grit.
</p>

<p>
The game went on, and no addition was
made to the score.  True, the school forwards
were getting most of the play, but they could
not break through the defence.  Kitty cleared
the ball away time after time, vowing inwardly
that they should not get through again.  Bertha
stuck to it with sturdy resolution; that streak
of sullen obstinacy in her character served her
in good stead now.  Duane had lost a little of
her unflurried, machine-like precision, and nearly
all of her casual coolness, but her hitting was as
clean and as hard as ever, and Paddy was
checked and held in her most desperate rushes.
France was gasping for breath, and Daisy was
limping painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Hurt?" inquired Duane, as they halted
for a twenty-five bully.
</p>

<p>
"No, not much," replied Daisy, bravely.
"But I'm afraid I can't run.  I've twisted my
foot over."
</p>

<p>
Somebody shouted out, "Buck up, the
school!  Only ten more minutes!"
</p>

<p>
"Get behind me," said Duane, quickly.
"I'll play centre-forward for the rest of the
game."
</p>

<p>
Now Paddy had the ball.  But before she
could pass, Duane had tackled her, taken
possession of the ball, and swung it out to Peggy.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, Peggy!" she cried.  "Take it
down on the wing."
</p>

<p>
Peggy responded pluckily, and gathering all
her remaining energies, spurted for all she was
worth, then centred wildly with her last effort.
Before anyone realized what was happening
Duane had caught the ball on her stick,
passed the right-back with a swerving run,
was inside the circle, and without pausing
had shot for goal.  The ball rose in the
air, twisting and spinning, and passed between
the posts and far beyond like a streak of
lightning.
</p>

<p>
The Carslake supporters cheered frantically
at this unexpected dénouement.  But the next
few minutes' play was still more amazing and
bewildering.  Duane took the bully now, and
with the adroitness of one thoroughly at home
at centre-forward, secured the ball and passed
it to her forward.  But the forwards had fought
so well that they were almost "done"&mdash;little
more could be got out of them.  The school
forwards were on the ball and had swept it
right to the goal.  Edith, on her knees, brought
off the best "save" of her experience, and
Kitty cleared the ball away, hitting right down
the centre with a splendid shot to Duane, some
instinct telling her what to do.
</p>

<p>
Duane stopped the ball with her foot and
was off like a flash, running like a hare and with
a control of the ball that at such a speed was
amazing.  The centre-half was out-distanced
and Duane held on her way.  With a feint
to the right she dodged round the back, swerved
sharply and, hardly pausing to steady herself,
shot with all the strength behind her strong
arms and shoulders.  The ball skimmed over
the ground and curled round the inside of the
post.  Carslake's had equalized.
</p>

<p>
Dazed and taken aback, the school lined up
in their places, hardly realizing what had
happened.  Perhaps their astonishment was their
undoing, for Duane and Daisy had wriggled
the ball through at the bully, and before the
school could pull themselves together, Duane
was racing down the field again.  Just before
she could be tackled she passed the ball with
delightful accuracy to France, who was quite
uncovered for the moment.  To her everlasting
credit, that budding artist rose to the occasion
nobly, for in spite of her "stitch," she carried
the ball well into the enemy's quarters and
without attempting what she knew was beyond
her powers, centred again to Duane.  The pass
was not an easy one, but once more Duane
had bobbed up in the right spot, and made no
mistake in intercepting it.  With her amazing
swerve she was past the first back, but before
she could shoot, the goalkeeper, running out,
had tackled her.  However, Duane's stick was
still behind the ball and the impetus of her
dash carried her forward a few staggering paces
to drop on her knees just beyond the posts,
while the ball rolled gently over the line and
came to rest a foot or two beyond.  It was
one of the most curious goals ever scored on
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Duane was on her feet, a little pale, and
panting audibly now; she picked up her stick
and walked back to the centre, unheeding the
loud cheering and commotion that was going
on around.  Hardly, however, had play
restarted, than the whistle rang out, loud and
prolonged.  The great match was over, and
Carslake's had defeated the Rest by the
extraordinary feat of scoring three goals in the last
ten or twelve minutes' play.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE CYCLING EXPEDITION
</h3>

<p>
The room commonly known as the "boot-room"
was crowded to overflowing with
girls.  Most of the house, in fact, with the
exception of the half-a-dozen senior girls, seemed
to be there.  The hockey players were busy
changing their muddy boots and washing their
hands in the basins, where there was plenty
of hot water and soap.  The rest were all
busy chattering excitedly to them about the
match.  Needless to say, the whole house was
jubilant and hardly knew how to contain
itself.
</p>

<p>
Amidst the babel of excited tongues, a
remark from one of the team was always listened
to with respect and interest.  "Who would
have dreamed it?" Babs was declaiming.
"Shan't we crow over the other houses now!
I really can't imagine how we did it."
</p>

<p>
"There's no use blinking at the facts," retorted
Peggy, bluntly.  "'Twas Duane that did most
of the doing.  We all did our best, but it was
Duane who won the match for us."
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't a player on the field to
touch her," declared Daisy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed Peggy.  "Didn't she run
those last two dashes down the field!  There
wasn't one who could overtake her.  And when
she shot for goal, she didn't give the goalkeeper
much chance."
</p>

<p>
"Her shooting always was fine," another
girl remarked.  "I can remember it in the
matches last year."
</p>

<p>
"But doesn't it seem simply rotten," came
from Peggy, slowly, "that a player like her
shouldn't be in the school eleven, playing for
the school.  Of course I know&mdash;" she paused,
uncomfortably.  "Well, I suppose it's her own
fault and the hockey club were right enough
to drop her and&mdash;and all that.  But, dash it
all, it seems such a waste!  I bet she's the
finest centre-forward Easthampton's ever had."
</p>

<p>
"And knowing that she can play like that,"
added Daisy, thoughtfully, "she must hate being
out of all the big matches."
</p>

<p>
Little Erica Salter had been standing near
by listening eagerly, motionless, her hands
hanging down by her sides, her eyes, with a very
rapt look in them, fixed on Daisy and Peggy
as they were speaking.  The emotional, sensitive
child was plainly stirred to the depths by the
thrilling happenings of the afternoon, of which
the tingling sense of excitement and triumph
still pervaded the whole atmosphere.  She spoke
up suddenly, when Daisy had finished:
</p>

<p>
"But supposing&mdash;just supposing Duane
never did it after all?"
</p>

<p>
"Well then, it would be jolly hard lines on
her, that's all I can say," replied Peggy.  "But
I don't see why we need bother our heads about
that.  Duane must have done it.  Nobody else
could have."
</p>

<p>
"But supposing another girl had done it,
and kept it secret?"
</p>

<p>
"Then all I can say is that she'd be the
meanest sort of creature alive," returned Peggy,
decidedly, "and if she were ever found out,
the girls would jolly well make the school too
hot to hold her."
</p>

<p>
Erica clasped her hands nervously together,
and said with solemn conviction, "I'm sure she
would deserve everything she got."
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment the door opened, and
in came Duane, Kitty and the other hockey
players, having washed and cleaned themselves
in their own cubicles.  They had come to change
their muddy footgear.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" exclaimed Duane, in her
soft familiar drawl.  "What a crowd!  The
whole house seems to have assembled in the
boot-room, evidently under the mistaken impression
that it's a hotel lounge.  Clear out, you
kids.  Don't you know tea bell's gone?"
</p>

<p>
There was a general scramble for the door.
Kitty, drawing on a pair of indoor shoes, was
overcome with laughter at the sight.  In a very
short time the room was cleared of all except
the hockey players themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, girls," Duane advised.  "You
know Miss Carslake hates anyone to be late
in to meals.  Everyone ready?"
</p>

<p>
Daisy stretched her arms above her head.
"Oh dear!  I'm sure I shall be stiff all over
to-morrow.  But it was worth being stiff for
the rest of the term.  I say, Duane," she added,
half hesitating, half wistfully.  "We didn't let
you down, did we?  Towards the end, you know."
</p>

<p>
Duane, her hand on the door-handle, turned
and faced them, lounging back against the door
with easy, unstudied grace, aristocrat in every
line of her.
</p>

<p>
"Let me down?" she repeated.  "No, of
course you didn't.  I tell you what, you kids,
you played up like heroes, and the house ought
to be jolly proud of you.  Kitty and Bertha
were as good as the school backs any day, while
Peggy's run got us the first goal, and France
rose to the occasion nobly at the last one.
Anyway, you've given the old place the shock of
its life."  She smiled at them with eyes that had
grown suddenly brilliant, and for the moment
everyone, even Kitty, forgot all about the
Richoter and all that had happened the previous
term.
</p>

<p>
"But it was you who scored the goals,"
said Peggy, honestly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," returned Duane, lightly.
"Didn't I tell you that was my one particular
forte.  Wait tell our next house match and
we'll see what we can do then."
</p>

<p>
She pushed open the door and led the way
out, France remarking that Miss Carslake could
hardly row them for being a few minutes late
for once, after the glory they had brought upon
the house.
</p>

<p>
The next day, Wednesday, being half-holiday,
Miss Carslake had arranged to take some
of the girls on a cycling expedition to the downs,
where recent excavations had disclosed traces of
both early Celtic and later Roman habitation.
The house mistress, who took the senior history
classes in the school, was apt to wax
enthusiastic over neolithic remains or mediæval
architecture, and during the summer months
organized many walking or cycling expeditions
to see a prehistoric barrow on the downs, or a
little village church with a Norman chancel, or
an architectural curiosity such as a low side
window or a hagioscope.
</p>

<p>
Some twelve or fifteen girls had given in
their names to the head prefect as desirous of
going.  Duane was in her study that evening,
making out this list, when there came a timid
tap on the door and Erica Salter entered.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  What is it?" inquired Duane,
glancing up.  "You, Erica!  What's up?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Erica.  "That is&mdash;"  She
glanced at Kitty, who was also in the room
writing letters, but there was evidently nothing
to be afraid of from that quarter, and Erica
continued, "That is to say, I&mdash;I want you to
ask Miss Carslake if I can come to-morrow to
Stretton Downs, Duane."
</p>

<p>
"You!  'Fraid not, Erica.  You're too small."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so very," protested Erica.  "And
I'm used to cycling.  I've got my bike here."
</p>

<p>
"It's too far for you," said Duane decidedly.
"Nine miles there and back."
</p>

<p>
"But I've often cycled as much as that in
a day, at home in the holidays.  Really and
truly I have."
</p>

<p>
"Bertha's not going, is she?" asked Duane,
glancing down at her list.
</p>

<p>
"No.  She doesn't want to.  She said she
hated anything to do with history.  But ask
her if I haven't cycled just as far these summer
holidays."
</p>

<p>
Duane hesitated.  "But what on earth do
you want to go for, kid?" she said somewhat
impatiently.  "You're not interested in Celtic
and Roman remains.  Goodness knows if I am,
for that matter, but I suppose I'm expected to
be."
</p>

<p>
Kitty, of course, had been listening to this
conversation.  Something in the child's obvious
eagerness touched her.  Besides, Erica had never
looked very well since that bad attack of
influenza the last term.  Her face was paler and
thinner, her dark eyes looked bigger.  It even
seemed to Kitty that there was something
strained and tense in her expression and
attitude, though probably that was merely
imagination on her part.  She broke in with:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let her go, Duane, as she seems so very
keen.  If she gets tired I'll undertake to give
her a push."
</p>

<p>
Duane shrugged her shoulders in her characteristic
fashion.  "I suppose, since Kitty takes
your part, I shall have to put your name down.
Kitty's quite capable of pushing herself and you
too; in fact, she'd doubtless enjoy the double
burden."
</p>

<p>
Kitty glanced sharply at Duane.  Was she
trying to be nasty, or was it merely her flippant,
cynical way of talking?  Impossible to tell.
</p>

<p>
Kitty glanced once more at Erica, who was
exclaiming gratefully, "Oh, thank you <i>ever</i> so
much, both of you!  You <i>are</i> two dears," and
said in a low voice to Duane:
</p>

<p>
"I don't think the child's looking very fit,
do you?"
</p>

<p>
Duane frowned slightly, then turned to Erica.
"I suppose you haven't anything on for the rest
of the evening?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nothing special.  I wanted to read,
but it's so noisy in the common-room.  It makes
my head ache."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down in that chair then, for a bit,"
said Duane abruptly, pointing with the handle
of her pen to the easy chair in front of the
hearth.  "Kitty and I are both busy, so it will
be quiet enough in here."
</p>

<p>
The child hesitated, flushing up.  "Are you
sure I shan't be in your way?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite."
</p>

<p>
"Then I should just love to."
</p>

<p>
She curled herself up in the chair before the
fire, and there was silence in the room, broken
only by the scratching of pens.  Erica sat quiet
and still, her dreamy gaze wandering from Duane
to Kitty, and from Kitty to Duane, and in her
soft dark eyes was the whole-hearted if childish
hero-worship that is so common and natural
between small schoolboys and girls and their
seniors, the girls and boys who are at top of the
school.  Presently, the warmth from the fire
making her drowsy, she dropped off to sleep,
her head against the back of the chair.
</p>

<p>
"She's asleep," said Kitty softly, glancing
up.  "I thought she looked tired."  She nibbled
her pen-handle, then went on hesitatingly, "I
say, Duane, I'm&mdash;I don't pretend to be very
observant and all that, but it has struck me that
the kid is&mdash;is worrying over something&mdash;has
got something on her mind."
</p>

<p>
Duane did not look very much impressed.
"What on earth should she have on her
mind?  Besides, there's her sister.  It's her
business to see if the kid's worried by anything."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know much about Bertha,"
went on Kitty, hesitating.  "To tell you the
truth, I never did take to her much.  But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not her great chum, either,"
interrupted Duane.  "Still, I do happen to
know that Bertha thinks the world of Erica
and can be trusted to look after her as much
as anybody.  But I think the child gets bad
attacks of homesickness, all the same.  However,
she'll grow out of that in time.  All decent
girls are happy enough at Easthampton."
</p>

<p>
Some inexplicable impulse prompted Kitty's
next words:
</p>

<p>
"Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to infer that I'm not
decent?" said Duane dryly.
</p>

<p>
Kitty flushed crimson.
</p>

<p>
"You know I didn't mean that."
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't.  I thought perhaps you were
still thinking of the Richoter," returned Duane
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wasn't," said Kitty bluntly.  "I
was merely asking a straightforward question.
I'm afraid I'm not used to playing about with
words, and I'm not clever at it like you."
</p>

<p>
"It comes in handy sometimes," murmured Duane.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose it does, when you don't
want to give a straightforward answer to a
straightforward question," retorted Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Or when you don't want to tell the
truth," added Duane, with laughter in her
eyes.  "Hallo, there goes the junior bell."  She
laid her hand on Erica's shoulder, and
shook her gently.  Erica opened her eyes and
blinked drowsily.
</p>

<p>
"Your bell has gone, kiddie," said Duane.
"I tell you what.  I'm going to carry you
upstairs to bed and send Bertha along with a
glass of hot milk.  You'll sleep like a top after
that."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;I'm much too heavy," protested
Erica, as the head prefect stooped and lifted
her out of the chair in her strong young arms.
</p>

<p>
Duane laughed contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm pretty strong, in spite of my
frail appearance."
</p>

<p>
She turned at the doorway, evidently holding
with ease the younger girl, whose fair silky
hair formed a striking contrast to her own dark
colouring, and glanced across at Kitty, saying
flippantly:
</p>

<p>
"Don't look too despondent, Kitty.  Cheer
yourself up with the thought that you won't
have to listen to my gifted conversation much
longer.  Hilary returns to-morrow evening.
She'll tell you plenty of home truths if you
want straightforward answers.  Sorry it's not
in my line."
</p>

<p>
When she had disappeared Kitty put down
her pen and stretched herself, then gazed round
the little room.  It would seem quite strange
to be back again in her own study.  She really
had got quite used to the company of France
and Duane, and their somewhat unusual little
ways.  In fact, Kitty was rather troubled and
uneasy when she discovered that not only had
she got used to the present arrangement, but
that she did not look forward at all to going
back to the old one.
</p>

<p>
"Of course that's only because changing
about is rather upsetting," she reproved
herself.  "Francie's a dear in many ways, but
you don't really want to stay on here with
Duane, of all girls."  Why, she had nearly
provoked a squabble that very evening!  Kitty
felt she had not yet recovered her equanimity
from the little passage of arms.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dash!"  Kitty surveyed her bicycle gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?"  Duane, her foot on her
pedal ready to mount, paused and looked back.
</p>

<p>
"My back tyre's down as flat as a pancake."
</p>

<p>
"A puncture?"
</p>

<p>
"'Fraid so," replied Kitty gloomily.  "I'll
see if I can pump it up, though."
</p>

<p>
A brief examination proved the fact beyond
a doubt.  Kitty looked at Duane.  The two
had been the last to leave the farmhouse&mdash;where
the cycling party had had tea&mdash;and were
the only girls left behind, the others having
ridden on a minute or two before Kitty's discovery.
</p>

<p>
"You ride on and overtake the others,"
she said.  "I'll mend the puncture and come
on afterwards.  If I scorch I might catch you
up some time.  Only it won't be long before
it gets dark."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll lend a hand," said Duane good-naturedly.
"I've got my lamps.  Besides, Miss
Carslake wouldn't like one of us to be left
alone."
</p>

<p>
"As to that, I'm quite capable of looking
after myself," returned the Australian girl rather
impatiently.  "But it's good of you to stay,
though, and keep me company."
</p>

<p>
The two girls were accustomed to mending
their own punctures.  They had some difficulty
at first in locating this one, but with the aid
of a bucket of water borrowed from the obliging
farm people, found it and patched it up.
</p>

<p>
"That's done at last!" exclaimed Kitty
with a sigh of relief, as she unscrewed her pump.
"Now we can get on.  Hallo, who on earth's
this?  Why," in great amazement, "it's
Bertha!  What on earth is she doing here?"
</p>

<p>
They hailed her, and in another minute
Bertha had ridden up and jumped off her
bicycle.  They could see that she was in a
state of great agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Is Erica with you?" she called out breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Erica?  No, she's with the others, I
expect," answered Kitty quickly.  "They went
on ahead some time ago.  Didn't you pass them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She wasn't with them.  They told
me she was behind with you.  I wasn't sure
of it, but I just said nothing and came on to
find you."
</p>

<p>
"But what are you doing here, Bertha?"
asked Duane, for Bertha had not been one of
the members of the cycling party.
</p>

<p>
"As you know," Bertha answered hurriedly,
"I went over to Sheerston's this afternoon.
When I came back I found Erica had left this
note behind for me, and I can tell you it nearly
knocked me over when I read it.  I borrowed
a bike from one of the girls and came on as
fast as I could, hoping to get here before you
left."  She had pulled an envelope from her
pocket as she spoke, and handed it over to
Duane.  The head prefect read it through
quickly and silently.  Her face was grave when
she handed it back.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!  So that's why she was so
anxious to come on the cycling expedition, is
it?  Poor little kid!  But why on earth should
she choose this way in which to run away from
school?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew she was unhappy," replied Bertha,
in a curiously hard tone.  "She's been miserable
ever since she's been back.  I don't know what
made her make up her mind, but she told me
she wished she could run away home.  I told
her not to be silly and that I shouldn't hear
of such a thing.  I meant to see she didn't
get any pretext for permission to go into town.
Then, as she says here, one of the weekly
boarders told her she knew this part of the
country, and you were going not far from her
home, at Frattenton, and Frattenton's on the
main line for <i>our</i> home&mdash;no changing."
</p>

<p>
"Where exactly is this place, Frattenton?"
asked Duane quickly.
</p>

<p>
"The other side of the downs&mdash;four or five
miles away.  The road to it runs right over
the downs."
</p>

<p>
"And it's the nearest railway station from here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
During the couple of minutes taken by this
hurried conversation, Kitty had stood silent,
listening, not knowing what was really the
matter, but gathering that it was something
serious.
</p>

<p>
Neither offered to show her the note; she
realized that there was some mystery about
it that Duane and Bertha both knew all about,
but that they did not wish to share with
anyone else.  She did not ask any questions, but
waited to see what would be required of her.
</p>

<p>
Duane turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"Erica's gone," she explained.  "She's run
away home.  She's slipped off across the downs
to Frattenton, to the railway station there."
</p>

<p>
Kitty nodded.
</p>

<p>
"What's to be done?" she said curtly.  "I
don't like the look of those downs.  There's
a heavy mist coming on and it's already getting
dark."
</p>

<p>
"Let's hope she's there by now then," said
Duane.  "Look here, two of us had better
ride after her, and the third one return to school
and let Prinny know what's up."
</p>

<p>
"Who's to go back?" asked Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"You had better," answered Duane, speaking
in decisive tones for once.  "You're done
up already with scorching so hard, I can see,
and you've got no lamps.  Kitty and I are
fresh.  That is to say, if Kitty doesn't mind
a tiring ride now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm on," said Kitty briefly.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll make a start.  Cheer up,
Bertha.  We'll see she's safe somewhere or other
and find out what's happened to her, all right."
</p>

<p>
"I know you will."  Bertha tried to muster
up a smile as she turned her bike round.
"You're a sport if ever there was one, Duane."
</p>

<p>
The next instant she had disappeared round
the bend, and Duane and Kitty were left alone
again, this time with a feeling of responsibility
resting heavily upon them.
</p>

<p>
"Better just ask about the road, at the
farm," suggested Kitty sensibly.  "We neither
of us know it."
</p>

<p>
A few brief questions elucidated the information
that the road wound over the downs to
Frattenton, that it was a lonely road, but that
there were few turnings of any importance, and then
one had to keep to the left.  The two girls mounted
and sped off, determined to cover the greater
part of the way before darkness settled down.
</p>

<p>
The first mile was a long drag uphill, but
the girls struggled gamely on.  Presently, to
their relief, they found themselves on high but
fairly level ground, and were too hot with their
exertions to feel the chill, penetrating damp that
was settling upon everything.  They made short
work of the next couple of miles.
</p>

<p>
Up till now they had met no sign of habitation.
Here, however, at the corner of a cross-road,
was a small, thatched cottage.  The place
looked deserted, but remembering the directions
given them, they held on to the left.  The road
dropped down into a little hollow.  Here they
came across another house, a square, stone
farm-house this time, with three or four children and
a couple of dogs playing about in the roadway.
</p>

<p>
They dismounted and inquired of the eldest
child if she had seen a girl of about her own age,
riding a bicycle, pass by within the last
half-hour.  The girl shook her head, and on being
questioned declared that they had been playing
in the road for quite a long time, but that she
had seen no one pass except Farmer Wootten's
wagon.  The smaller children said the same.
</p>

<p>
Duane looked at Kitty rather perplexedly.
</p>

<p>
"Funny they should have missed her.  She
can't have passed here very long ago."
</p>

<p>
The girls mounted again, but had not gone
very far&mdash;only round the next bend&mdash;when they
came across a horse and cart and two road
menders, just preparing to leave their work of
laying down granite and start their return
journey to Frattenton.  Here the two cyclists
were brought "up against it" very definitely,
for both men stated positively and convincingly
that no one had passed that way for the last
hour save a man driving a farm wagon, for they
had been working on the road all the time.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
A NIGHT ON THE DOWNS
</h3>

<p>
The two girls stood and looked at each
other in dismayed silence.
</p>

<p>
Kitty thought rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"If she <i>has</i> come this way, it must have
been in the last half-hour.  I remember seeing
her leave the tea-table when the other girls did,
and thought she was with them when they went
to get their bikes.  I wasn't more than twenty
minutes mending that puncture, so that we
weren't more than half-an-hour behind when
we left.  And we've most likely reduced that,
for we've covered the ground quicker than she
could, I bet."
</p>

<p>
"Then, if she has not passed here," Duane
demanded, "where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"There's only one turning she could possibly
have mistaken for the Frattenton road.  You
remember the one where that cottage was."
</p>

<p>
She turned to one of the men.
</p>

<p>
"Where does the road to the right, a little
way back, go to?"
</p>

<p>
"That!" replied the man.  "That don't
lead to nowhere, miss.  That be only a road
fur th' farm carts.  It ends in a sheep track
across th' downs."
</p>

<p>
"And how far on is Frattenton?" inquired
Duane.
</p>

<p>
"Barely two miles, miss."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if she has passed here she's there by
now all right," remarked Kitty.  "Only,
supposing she's taken the wrong road and is
wandering over the downs now?  I know what downs
are."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better make inquiries at the cottage,"
said Duane briefly.
</p>

<p>
So they hurriedly pedalled back to the little
thatched cottage, and after some trouble
succeeded in routing out an old woman with a
sweet, quavering voice and some difficulty in
hearing distinctly.  However, when they had
explained their errand, she was most eager and
voluble in giving them information.
</p>

<p>
Why yes, to be sure, a little lady on a
bicycle had come to the door, maybe half an
hour back, and asked if she were on the right
road to Frattenton.  The kindly old soul had
invited her in to rest a minute by the fire and
have a glass of milk, "for she had looked so
tired-like, and 'twas a long pull along the
Frattenton road."  The offer had evidently been
too much for Erica to resist, for she had left
her bicycle outside and gone in.
</p>

<p>
"And how long has she been gone?" interrupted
Duane quickly.
</p>

<p>
"A matter o' ten minutes or perhaps a
quarter of an hour, I should say, miss,"
quavered the old lady.
</p>

<p>
"And did you see which road she took?"
</p>

<p>
"Why no, miss.  I didn't go down to th'
gate wi' she.  You see, my rheumatics is that
bad&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Kitty and Duane, with a hurried thanks,
were already outside the door and running down
to their bikes.
</p>

<p>
"Just missed her at the turn here, then,"
said Duane.  "Jove, but it's getting thick!"
</p>

<p>
"Better light up," said Kitty quietly, and
they lit their lamps with fingers that trembled
with impatience.
</p>

<p>
"What luck for us those road-menders were
there," said Kitty as they pedalled forward.
"Or else we should have been nearly in Frattenton
by now.  Bother it, it's uphill again!"
</p>

<p>
"And getting jolly rough too," added Duane,
as she bumped violently over a big stone.
</p>

<p>
The road was certainly getting rough.
Presently great ruts appeared in it and the
two cyclists had to go very warily.  To add
to their difficulties a thick, chill mist was
settling over the downs in addition to the falling
darkness.  Soon it would be impossible to see
many yards ahead, even with their lamps.
</p>

<p>
"One thing," observed Kitty, "if our progress
is slow, so is Erica's.  She can't be very
far ahead.  In fact, I wonder she hasn't turned
back by now, realizing that this can't be the
main road."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if she has any lamps," said
Duane uneasily.
</p>

<p>
The next minute her front wheel ran into
a rut; the bicycle skidded sharply and threw
her off.
</p>

<p>
Kitty dismounted.  "Hurt?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," replied Duane with a laugh.
"Came off on my feet all right.  But I guess
we'd better walk, and wheel our bikes.  It'll
be just as quick in this awful mist and darkness."
</p>

<p>
The two girls pressed forward with dogged
courage.  They were neither of them timid
or nervous, each had confidence in the other,
and no doubt, but for the anxiety of Erica's
safety, would have enjoyed it as a "real
adventure."
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  What's this?"  Kitty came to
an abrupt halt.
</p>

<p>
"Erica's bike.  She's left it by the roadside
and gone forward on foot.  There's her
front lamp on it, unlit&mdash;but perhaps she had
no matches," a surmise they afterwards found
out to be fact.
</p>

<p>
"We'd better leave ours here too.  They're
more nuisance than use now we can't ride them.
We can take the front lamps with us."
</p>

<p>
So they propped their bicycles by the side
of the road, which was now little more than a
track.  The dense mist had settled down thicker
than ever, so that they could hardly make out
the ground at their feet, and the lamps only
seemed to light up and reveal a few yards of
greyish vapour.  It all felt very weird and
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
To go on now had become a matter of real
danger.  But Erica was somewhere ahead, in
the darkness, alone, and to go back was
impossible.
</p>

<p>
The two girls shouted and halloed at the
top of their voices, but the mist only returned
the echoes of their own cries.
</p>

<p>
"Coming on?" asked Duane curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," returned Kitty as briefly.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep to the track though.  Won't
do to get lost ourselves."
</p>

<p>
They stumbled forward again, neither of
them daring to voice their secret fear that
Erica, frightened and lonely and without a
light, had wandered off the track when the
mist and the darkness had descended so quickly,
and was lost on the downs.  Such a possibility
made them both shiver.  They stopped at brief
intervals and shouted, Kitty raising piercing
calls of "Coo-ee!" and then listening intently,
but with no result.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to say how far they had
gone&mdash;their only guide was the track, which
they dared not leave and which they followed
mainly by the feel of it beneath their feet&mdash;when
at last Kitty's sharp ears caught a faint, answering
call.  They advanced, shouting again, and
again came the faint answer from the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Kitty halted.  "It's from our left somewhere,
not ahead.  Come on."
</p>

<p>
They turned to their left and by the light
of their lamps advanced cautiously over the
down turf, guided by the voice.  Before long,
a dark mass loomed up with startling
suddenness in the pale rays of their lamps.  It was a
shepherd's hut, and inside, crouched in a forlorn
heap upon the hard, bare floor, they found the
runaway.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-178"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-178.jpg" alt="&quot;Crouched in a forlorn heap upon the floor, they found the runaway.&quot;">
<br>
&quot;Crouched in a forlorn heap upon the floor, they found the runaway.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so glad you've come.  I'm so
c-cold and t-tired."
</p>

<p>
"However did you find this place?" asked
Kitty, peering around.
</p>

<p>
"You see, the road got so rough," Erica
replied in a tired voice.  "I left my bike and
walked, and then I knew I must have taken
the wrong road; but I was so tired, I didn't
want to go all the way back.  I thought perhaps
it would lead to some houses or a village if I
kept on.  But it got so dark and I was
frightened.  I couldn't see my way and then I was
wandering about and I ran right into this hut.
Oh, I wish I was home.  I heard you calling
at last, but there's a big blister on my heel,
and I&mdash;I c-can't walk any more."
</p>

<p>
The child was worn out and exhausted;
moreover, she was shaking with cold.  Duane
slipped off her heavy coat with its big fur collar
and cuffs.  "Just put this on a minute," she
said, "and it'll warm you, for I was simply
boiling after the rate we've pounded along to
catch you up."
</p>

<p>
She glanced at Kitty, who was investigating
their little shelter by the light of a lamp.  The
place had evidently been quite recently
inhabited, for it was in excellent repair and as
dry as a bone.  On the other hand, it was
quite bare, consisting of absolutely nothing but
walls, roof and door.  True, there was a
fireplace, but as Kitty remarked, it was no good
without any fuel, and of fuel, wet or dry, there
was not a stick to be had anywhere, and they
had no implements with which they could break
away any of the boarding of the hut.
</p>

<p>
"If we could only get a fire," sighed Kitty
wistfully, "we'd stay here the night.  It would
be quite jolly.  But we should simply freeze
otherwise.  I'm sure it'll freeze if it gets much
colder."
</p>

<p>
Duane went to the door and peered out.
The mist was covering everything with icy
drops of water, and it was densely black
everywhere.  She drew back with a shiver.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Kitty, do you think we should find
the track again?  Then, of course, we could
get back to the Frattenton road.  We could
carry the kid between us."
</p>

<p>
"The point is," replied Kitty, somewhat
grimly, "that if we risked the chance of finding
the track and failed, ten chances to one if we
should be able to find the hut again.  In that
case we should be wandering about the downs
in this icy mist, and Erica, for one, isn't in a
fit condition to do much wandering.  On the
other hand, if we stay here for the night,"&mdash;she
looked at Duane with a faint smile&mdash;"I've
no doubt we shall need all our courage if we are
going to stick it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your courage is all right," said Duane
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;I sort of&mdash;believe you've got plenty
too," muttered Kitty under her breath.  Then
aloud, "Well, let's have a little rest and make
up our minds what to do."
</p>

<p>
It was the discovery of the straw that settled
the matter&mdash;a big truss of it in the corner, dry
as a bone, and clean and fragrant.  They did
not waste time considering the reason for its
being there, but decided to settle down in the
hut, now that they had something that might
keep the warmth in their bodies.  They spread
it on the floor and curled up on it, wishing that
there was twice the quantity so that they might
burrow right in.  They were all wearing their
big coats, and Kitty and Duane were quite
warm from their hard cycling and walking; but
Erica was shivering with cold.  So Kitty and
Duane set to work vigorously to rub her arms
and legs until the blood began to circulate again.
</p>

<p>
They huddled up together on the straw, with
Erica in the middle.  It was to Duane, Kitty
noted with some surprise, that the child turned
for comfort and protection, and the bigger girl
seemed to respond with a queer, sympathizing
tenderness that Kitty had never dreamed her
capable of.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you two were ancient and bitter
enemies," she said with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I hated Duane once," responded
the child with quaint gravity.  "But I don't
now.  It was very silly of me.  Duane is a
dear," with an affectionate, almost passionate
hug.
</p>

<p>
"Duane is an ass," said that person herself,
"and Kitty is one too, to let two lamps
go on burning when one would do."
</p>

<p>
"You made a rhyme," murmured Erica sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's nothing I can't do if I like
to try," said Duane modestly.  "You know,
I didn't say what kind of an ass I was, did I?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  What kind are you?"
</p>

<p>
"A geni-ass."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  You are silly!"  A gleam of fun
struggled with the sadness in the child's face.
"And I'm a horrid little pig, that's what I am."
</p>

<p>
"What rubbish!" said Duane hastily.  "I
say, Kitty, you haven't gone to sleep, have
you?  Do you know it's not much past seven o'clock?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?  How awful!  No, I don't
feel a bit sleepy."  She tried to imitate Duane's
gay, careless flippancy.  "What shall us do?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, something fairly primitive.  Not
even as elaborate as 'noughts and crosses,'
seeing we've neither pencil nor paper."
</p>

<p>
"Nor much light to see with," added Kitty.
"We shall have to pretend we're Indians in
a wigwam."
</p>

<p>
"Or Eskimos in a snow hut.  I hope you're
warm enough, little Eskimo?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I'm lovely and warm now," replied Erica.
</p>

<p>
"We are disciples of the Simple Life,"
continued Duane.  "What could be a simpler
way of living than this?  Erica, think how
years hence you'll tell your grandchildren and
your great-grandchildren how you were lost
on the downs and spent the night in a wooden
hut with the howling of savage wolves outside,
thirsting for your blood."
</p>

<p>
"But that would be an awful whopper,"
objected Erica.  "There aren't any wolves left
in England."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't there?  What a pity!  However,
to come back to our original question.  What
shall we do to pass away the time?"
</p>

<p>
"You and Kitty can tell stories," suggested
Erica brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!  But I don't know any,"
protested Kitty in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you tell one out of your head?"
</p>

<p>
"But how can I, when there aren't any in there?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Duane will, then."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Duane resignedly.
"What sort of a story do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind."
</p>

<p>
"It'll have to be a nonsensical one then.
I couldn't tell a sensible one in a senseless place
like this.  No genius could.  Let me see,"
thoughtfully, "did I tell you the story of my uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's rather sad, but never mind.
It was something most extraordinary that
happened to my Uncle Bill&mdash;or was it my Uncle
John?  Never mind, it was one of them.  It
must have been, because they're the only two
uncles I've got.  Well, he was standing one
day in front of his fire, when a dreadful thing
occurred.  His backbone melted."
</p>

<p>
"What!" gasped Erica.
</p>

<p>
"His backbone melted.  Of course, that
made him very ill, but fortunately the doctors
knew what to do.  They packed him round in
ice and it froze again, and now he's walking
about just the same as ever."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe it," cried Erica scornfully.
"It couldn't happen."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that.  I'm telling
you just what he told me."
</p>

<p>
"Then your uncle was only telling you
stories."
</p>

<p>
"I think that depends on which uncle it
was.  You see, Uncle John is a very truthful
man.  But my Uncle Bill probably doesn't
always tell the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was your Uncle Bill who told you
about it," said Erica conclusively.
</p>

<p>
Kitty had been struggling to repress her
mirth.  At last she said:
</p>

<p>
"Can't you tell us something a bit less
gruesome than that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," cried Erica, "a happy-ever-after
one."
</p>

<p>
"In that case it'll have to be a fairy story,"
decided Duane.  "Very well then."
</p>

<p>
She began her story while the other two
listened, the light of the bicycle lamp flickering
on the little group, picking out in particular
the clear-cut, aristocratic profile of the narrator.
Kitty lay looking at it dreamily and finding a
curious pleasure in doing so, never realizing
until now what a fascinating face it could be
to watch, not exactly for any particular beauty
of feature, nor even for the vividness of the
light grey eyes in their dark setting, but for
something elusive in its rather sleepy expression.
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time," she began, "there was
a king over a far Eastern land, and this king
had three tall, brave sons.  The two eldest were
said to be the handsomest men in the whole
kingdom, but though the youngest was just as
big and strong, and his hair was just as golden
and his eyes as blue, he had a thorn in the
flesh&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Like St. Paul," interrupted Erica eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Only we don't know what St. Paul's
was, but we do know the prince's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then what was it?" put in Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Don't interrupt or you'll mix me up," said
the narrator severely.  "Let me see, where was I?"
</p>

<p>
"At the beginning, I should say," said Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"One day there came a herald from the
neighbouring kingdom.  Everyone knew he
came from the neighbouring kingdom because he
wore his master's coat-of-arms&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What was the coat-of-arms like?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;two lions couchant and one pard
rampant upon a field of azure.  He stood on
the steps of the king's palace, blew his
thingummyjig&mdash;I mean his trumpet, and shouted,
'Oyez!  Oyez!  Oyez!  To all busybodies whom
it may concern.  Anyone bringing back the
stolen princess to her sorrowing father, King
Baldhead, will be given her hand in marriage
and half her father's kingdom.'  At that, there
was great commotion everywhere.  The three
princes sent for the herald and asked him how
the princess had been stolen.  He told them
that she had been carried off in the wink of an
eye by a dreadful witch disguised as a whirlwind.
The princess's father had consulted her
fairy godmother and she said that he who wished
to rescue the princess must follow his nose until
he found her.
</p>

<p>
"'That is an easy matter,' quoth the eldest
prince.  'I will set out at once,' and he called
for his finest horse and his ten body-servants
and rode out in state, giving orders that no one
else was to set forth on the quest.  Because he
was so handsome he was vain, and because he
was vain he was selfish.
</p>

<p>
"A year passed away and he did not return.
Then the second prince set out in the same
manner, for he also was vain and selfish, and
at the end of a year he had not returned either.
</p>

<p>
"Then the youngest prince, who was neither
vain nor selfish, told his father that he too
would try his luck.  He, however, set out alone
and on foot, for he said he thought he could
follow his nose better thus.  And when he had
walked and walked without stopping for three
days, the earth suddenly opened in front of him
and out stepped the princess.  She smiled
radiantly upon him, and said, 'Dear prince, you
have broken the witch's spell and set me free,'
and they went back to her father hand in hand."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the other two princes?
What had happened to them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they were never heard of for seven
years, and then the eldest one came riding along.
He had followed his nose right round the world
until he got back to the place from where he
started.  And exactly a year later, the other
one turned up."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't see," objected Erica in a
drowsy voice, and opening one sleepy eye, "why
the youngest prince found her and they didn't."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, you see, that's just where the
point of the 'thorn' comes in.  The two oldest
princes had Grecian noses, but the youngest
prince had a crooked one.  Consequently he'd
been going round and round in a circle, and
when he'd gone round twelve times that broke
the spell, you know, and the earth opened.
Don't you remember the fairy rings?"
</p>

<p>
"But how could the princess marry a prince
with a crooked nose?" murmured Erica, with
a last effort.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've no doubt the fairy godmother
could put that straight.  I don't see the use of
having a fairy godmother if she couldn't do
little jobs like that," replied Duane.  Erica,
however, had not heard.  She was fast asleep.
"Supposing one of them had had a retroussé
nose," remarked Kitty meditatively.  "What
would have happened then?"
</p>

<p>
"He'd have made a journey to heaven,
doubtless," retorted the story-teller.
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a little while, save
for Erica's steady breathing.  Then Kitty said
softly, so as not to disturb her:
</p>

<p>
"How do you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Do what?"
</p>

<p>
"Talk&mdash;like that."
</p>

<p>
"Talk rubbish, do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"If you like to put it that way.  Just as
if you hadn't a serious thought or a care in the
world&mdash;as if our situation wasn't&mdash;well&mdash;decidedly
an uncomfortable one?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  Because I'm a geni-ass,
I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell you what I think?  You just do
it to keep everybody's spirits up and be cheerful."
</p>

<p>
"You mean, to make out to people I'm not
afraid or I don't care?  Yes, perhaps I do,"
replied Duane, with a note of thoughtfulness
in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't mean that a bit.  You do
it just because you aren't afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, am I not?  I feel in an awful funk
at times, but I should feel frightfully humiliated
if I let anyone see or guess it."
</p>

<p>
There was another pause.  Duane was
evidently in a thoughtful and unusually serious
mood, for she went on:
</p>

<p>
"I've an unfortunate manner, I believe,
but I've been brought up to think it correct
and couldn't get rid of it now if I wanted to
try.  I always ambled along here happily and
serenely enough till all the Carslake
Sixth-formers took it into their heads to leave and
Prinny sent for me and informed me that she
intended giving me the honour of the head
prefectship.  I funked it horribly, but Prinny
was a dear and I had to take it on.  Honestly,
I meant to do my best, though I felt rather
crushed.  Do you remember that frightfully
serious jaw Prinny gave us, the beginning of
last term?  But I'm terribly lazy, I know,
and as I said, I've an unfortunate manner and
I'm afraid I made a hopeless mess of things."
</p>

<p>
Duane gave her explanations with matter-of-fact,
almost impersonal simplicity.  Kitty's
thoughts were in such a jumble that she hardly
knew what to say.  She felt she must say
something of what was in her mind, though, so she
blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"That's all nonsense.  A mess, indeed!
Look at Sports Day&mdash;look at the hockey match&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, I do happen to be fairly decent
at hockey," said Duane curtly.  "It's the one
thing I'm proud of.  But that doesn't make
me a success as a head prefect, does it?"
</p>

<p>
"Success or not," returned Kitty, "the
house has pulled itself together again, and taken
up its proper place in the school, and the head
prefect takes the glory as well as the
responsibility.  That's only fair."
</p>

<p>
Duane grunted.
</p>

<p>
"By the by, I've some news to tell you.
I had a letter from Hilary this morning.  The
doctors think she had better not come back
after all.  Say she wants a complete rest from
studies for at least a year, if her headaches
are to be cured.  Rough luck on Hilary, isn't
it?  She's keen on her work."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'm awfully sorry," said Kitty sincerely.
"She was clever too, and a good sort."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Hilary was always decent.
Though I fancy she didn't quite approve of me.
It's rather hard lines on you too, having your
study-mate taken away.  A pity!" with a
mocking note in her voice, and the drawl back
again.  "But perhaps you can still put up with
France and me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'm sorry we took a dislike to each
other at the beginning," said Kitty in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
"You did, you mean.  I never disliked you."
</p>

<p>
Kitty looked surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Why yes, you did.  Besides, don't you
remember how I squeezed a sponge over you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that!  I thought it was frightful cheek
on your part, but then, I've plenty of cheek
myself."
</p>

<p>
"And when I challenged you to tennis?"
</p>

<p>
"And beat me?  Did I look so furious?"
</p>

<p>
"You never turned a hair.  But I thought
you were simply wild, inwardly."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I was.  But I hope I'm sportsman
enough not to show it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're a sportsman all right," said
Kitty with conviction.  "But if you didn't
dislike me extremely, how did you feel about me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I rather liked you when I first saw you.
I thought you looked a decent sort and a
thorough sport, and I said to myself that you'd
make a welcome addition to the house.  And
then I saw that you disliked me for some reason
or other&mdash;in fact, rather despised me&mdash;and so I
just didn't care.  I was rather sorry, but I
wouldn't have let you see it for worlds.
Perhaps, too, my pride was hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did dislike you and feel
rather&mdash;contemptuous," confessed Kitty, laughing under
her breath.  "You see, I'd never met anyone
like you before.  You were quite a new
experience.  It began when I first saw your name
painted right across your trunk, 'The Hon.
Duane l'Estrange Estevan,' and I said to myself,
'What a name!'  I had a horror of anything
aristocratic and a great contempt for laziness in
any form whatever, and I thought you were
both.  I'm beginning to have my doubts about
the laziness, however."
</p>

<p>
"We'll put it down to my 'unfortunate
manner,'" conceded Duane generously, "though
I won't deny it."
</p>

<p>
"Your manner is all that it should be,"
declared Kitty firmly, "so don't try to alter it.
You couldn't be you without it.  I was a silly fool."
</p>

<p>
"Then you really think that we might
become quite good friends in time?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty flushed.  "I'd be proud," she said in
a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"And the Richoter?  Have you forgotten that?"
</p>

<p>
Kitty's flush faded.  Yes, strange to say, she
had forgotten all about it.  It had never once
entered her head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have.  I don't care a hang about the
Richoter," she replied sturdily.
</p>

<p>
Duane ran a gentle hand over the fair silky
head nestling so confidingly against her shoulder,
and a smile lit her eyes and then hovered on
her lips&mdash;a smile that was strangely sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, hang the Richoter!" she repeated softly.
</p>

<p>
A little later and all three girls were sleeping
soundly.  But the time when they needed all
they had of pluck and endurance was yet to
come.  As the hours passed, the chill, raw,
penetrating cold crept through the thin covering
of straw and through their thick overcoats.
They awoke in the early hours of the morning
when it was still inky dark, cramped and cold
right through.  By the feeble light of the
remaining lantern the mist could be seen
hovering in greyish wisps in the bare hut.  They
tramped up and down the narrow space at their
disposal and went through all the drill tables
they could remember, to keep circulation
flowing.  The two older girls looked after the
younger as best they could, realizing that she
was not only the youngest but the frailest
physically of the three.  As Duane remarked
cheerfully, she and Kitty were "as hard as nails."
</p>

<p>
The colder they grew, the higher Duane's
spirits seemed to rise, and the more nonsense
she talked.  Kitty and Erica had not her
aptitude in that way, but they showed their grit
by their readiness to laugh.  Kitty came to a
better realization of the head prefect's
character in those three hours before the dawn.  The
Australian had as much courage as any one, but
the other girl's was of a kind she had not
understood till now; it sprang from a pride that
would meet danger or death with a laugh and
a jest rather than a prayer; the same pride of
race that sent the old French aristocrats to the
guillotine as if they were driving to the King's
levee at Versailles.
</p>

<p>
Erica, too, never murmured.  Duane and
Kitty declared she was a little brick.
</p>

<p>
The three hours seemed like years.  At last,
however, a faint grey light began to filter into
hut.  The girls crept out, with chattering teeth,
and taking it in turns to carry the crippled
Erica pick-a-back until they should find their
bicycles, set off in search of the cart track that
was their only guide.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE TRUTH OF IT ALL
</h3>

<p>
The Principal received a telephone message
in the morning from Frattenton, to the
effect that the missing ones had arrived safely
in the early hours, having spent the night in a
shepherd's hut on the downs.  Miss St. Leger,
with a heart considerably lightened, recalled her
search parties and sent back instructions for the
girls to be brought to Easthampton by train,
after they had been fed and cared for by the
kindly owners of the George Inn at Frattenton.
The school went in to afternoon lessons with
the excitement of the morning calmed down,
and a little later the three girls arrived.
</p>

<p>
Nurse insisted on sending Erica to bed at
once, with hot blankets and bottles, but the
two seniors protested that they felt none the
worse for their adventure, for they had been
given hot baths and had their clothes thoroughly
dried at Frattenton.  Indeed, they looked none
the worse.  Nurse gave in, on the condition that
they went to bed early in the evening and had
a "proper night's rest."
</p>

<p>
The two received a summons from the Principal
to tea in her room.
</p>

<p>
"We're honoured," said Duane to Kitty with
a laugh.  "It's only on very special occasions
that girls have tea with Prinny."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later found them comfortably
ensconced in easy chairs before a bright fire, in
the Principal's charming little sitting-room, with
cups of tea in their hands and plates of the
same delicate and fragile china on their knees.
The Principal talked to them pleasantly while
they had tea, and Kitty thought what a charming
woman she was; though, to be sure, nothing
out of the ordinary to look at!
</p>

<p>
Then, after the maid had cleared the tea-things
away, she drew a chair up next to Duane's
and said with a sudden change to gravity:
</p>

<p>
"And now, Duane, for a very serious little
talk.  I want to know exactly what happened
in this distressing affair of the Richoter
examination.  I know, of course, that there has been a
good deal of trouble in the school over it and
that you have been very much concerned in it.
I want to hear your version of the affair&mdash;all
you know about it."
</p>

<p>
Duane hesitated, looking perplexed.  Miss
St. Leger, who was watching her closely, went
on quietly:
</p>

<p>
"Need I say that I already know almost all
there is to know?  The cycling expedition and
its sequel have at last brought things to a head,
I am thankful to say.  I insisted on an explanation
from Bertha, and under the circumstances
she could do nothing but give me it: I have
seen the note for her which Erica left behind.
But I want your version of the story as well&mdash;all
of it."
</p>

<p>
Duane drew a deep breath.
</p>

<p>
"I was hoping that it would never come
out," she said with a faint smile, "and yet of
course, now it has&mdash;well, I do feel relieved."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can quite realize that," said Miss
St. Leger, somewhat dryly.
</p>

<p>
"You know who did it, then?" queried
Duane.
</p>

<p>
Kitty was sitting forward in her chair, tense
with eagerness.  The mystery that had puzzled
her and the rest of the school for so long, was
to be revealed at last.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, little Erica Salter was the culprit."
</p>

<p>
Kitty uttered a cry of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Erica Salter&mdash;that child!"
</p>

<p>
Duane nodded.  "Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But surely&mdash;" stammered Kitty, "she
could not think of such a thing herself.  Why,
what does a child like her know of chemistry
experiments?"
</p>

<p>
"That is one of the little points I want
Duane to make clear," put in Miss St. Leger.
"Yes, Kitty can stay and hear, since I believe
she also narrowly escaped serious trouble over
the affair."
</p>

<p>
"Through my incorrigible laziness," added
Duane, with a drawl in her voice.  "How I
blessed Miss Vacher at that moment for
disturbing me!"
</p>

<p>
"Begin at the beginning," advised Miss St. Leger.
</p>

<p>
So the head prefect told her story, quite
simply and with some embarrassment, her two
listeners hanging intently upon every word.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that Erica, in her blind, childish
adoration of the redoubtable Peggy O'Nell,
regarded that rebel's natural enemy, the head
prefect, in the light of a hateful tyrant.  Her
highly-coloured imagination, in fact, exaggerated
and magnified the attempts of the prefect to
put down the junior leader, and after the
ordering-off of Peggy from the sports field, her
seething indignation crystallized into a fierce
determination to avenge the insult offered to that
much-wronged damsel.
</p>

<p>
How this was to be accomplished she had
no idea; probably her feelings would have
calmed down before long without any harm
whatever being done, but a few chance words
from Bertha&mdash;words not said in a very kindly
spirit&mdash;put the whole idea into her head, an
idea which would otherwise have never entered it.
</p>

<p>
The Richoter candidates had been giving
an account of their morning's experiences in
the laboratory, when they left it for the dinner
hour.  Bertha, with Erica, had been among
the listeners.  Strolling off afterwards, the older
girl, speaking her thoughts aloud, had said
with a laugh:
</p>

<p>
"Now, a very simple way of upsetting any
of their apple-carts would be to meddle with
the balances just now.  A little weight stuck
underneath the pan with a piece of putty would
do the trick.  Simple but effective, eh?"
</p>

<p>
It had been carelessly spoken and Bertha
did not dream that anyone had taken notice
of her words, or in fact heard them, save her
little sister; and Erica, fired by impulse,
resolved in that way to avenge the wrongs done
to Peggy and her confreres by the tyrannous
head prefect, who was so mean and horrid to
them.
</p>

<p>
It never occurred to Erica that the laboratory
door might be carefully locked to ensure
against any tampering with the unfinished
experiments.  A weight?  A little piece of
stone would do.  Putty?  A bit of plasticine
out of one of the tins in her classroom, which
was quite near the laboratory!  The school-rooms
would be deserted now; no one would
see her.  What could be simpler?  And if
Duane didn't get her experiment correct, it
would serve her right.  Oh yes, she deserved it all!
</p>

<p>
Had Erica paused to think, it would never
have been done.  But the blind impulse aroused
by her passionate adoration of Peggy, drove
her straight into the school and up the stairs
towards the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
It was the most extraordinary coincidence
that she should be following close on the heels
of Kitty, intent on Miss Vacher's errand, though
Erica was just too far behind to see her; and
also a coincidence that Erica, slipping in
noiselessly in her drill shoes (it had been drill last
lesson that morning), should neither be seen
nor heard by Kitty, who at that moment was
at the other end of the room beyond the
high-backed benches, pausing in the act of hunting
for a clean pipette in order to gaze out of the
window to see the reason for the loud noise of
a motor engine misfiring on the country road
outside.  Neither knew of the other's presence.
Erica had done her work in a few seconds and
was gone before Kitty recrossed the room with
the pipette, and left, locking the door again
behind her.
</p>

<p>
But the point of the whole affair lay in the
fact that Erica, who had not stopped to think,
and was in such a state of agitation as hardly
to know what she was doing, made a mistake
over the balances and weighted Salome's instead
of Duane's.  She had heard Eileen describe
herself as in the middle of the first bench near
the door, with Salome on her right and Duane
on her left, but she did not stop to consider
which would be Eileen's right and which her
left; there was the end of the bench conveniently
just inside the door, and in her agitation
it did not dawn upon her that Duane might
be at the other end.  "Which shows," Duane
put in somewhat quaintly, "that she was not
cut out for a conspirator, at any rate."
</p>

<p>
Then had come the inquiry in the hall and
with it so complete a realization of the enormity
of the thing which she had done, that the
highly-strung, sensitive child, with visions of
awful punishments floating before her eyes,
could no more come forward and confess her
guilt in front of them all than she could have
taken wings and flown.
</p>

<p>
"Up to then," went on Duane, "I knew
no more about the affair than any of you.  All
I knew was that the keys had never left my
possession during the dinner interval save once.
I had not done it myself; I could only think
Kitty was the culprit.  I am afraid," looking
across at Kitty, "I did you an injustice there."
</p>

<p>
"And I," responded Kitty with a smile,
"knew <i>I</i> hadn't done it, and I could only think
<i>you</i> had.  We were both mistaken.  Of course,
what put us all on the wrong track was the
fact that it was Salome's balances that had
been meddled with.  She's so popular with all
the girls.  We could only put it down to
motives of house jealousy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, up till the evening, as I said, I was
as much in the dark as anyone," continued
Duane, and went on to narrate how she had
received a visit from Bertha and a white,
trembling Erica, who had confessed to her older sister
what she had done, knowing that Bertha would
somehow help her.  Bertha, startled and horrified,
had sternly enjoined the younger child that
on no account must she breathe a word of it
to anyone else until she, Bertha, gave her
permission.  Bertha meant that it should never
have been found out, if <i>she</i> could help it, no
matter what happened.
</p>

<p>
But she had to do something to calm
the frightened, conscience-stricken child.  They
could tell Duane, she said, and ask her advice.
She was the one Erica had meant to injure.
</p>

<p>
So Bertha, in the interview that passed
between the three girls, had paved the way by
explaining that Erica was in trouble and wanted
Duane's advice, but she must first promise not
to say a word to anyone else.  Duane, never
dreaming what the trouble really was and thinking
it was just some childish scrape Erica had
been inveigled into, gave her word.  Even she
could not conceal her amazement and dismay
when she heard the "confession."  She was
troubled and perplexed, more so than she had
ever been in her life before, and did not know
what she ought to do for the best.  She tried
to persuade the child to go to the Principal and
confess, pointing out that Miss St. Leger could
be trusted to understand and would not be
harsh on her.  Erica, however, in her
over-wrought state, could not credit this.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Bertha, too, was fiercely
determined that, if possible, it should never be
known, pointing out that Erica was but a child
and had not realized what she was doing, and
that in time the whole affair would die down
and be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"It was Bertha's influence against mine,"
Duane explained, "and of course, Bertha's was
the stronger."
</p>

<p>
Duane, moved by the pitifulness of the
child's shrinking fear and whole-souled repentance
to a tenderness which, in spite of all her
faults, she was evidently capable of feeling,
tried to comfort her, resolving that if Erica
could not summon sufficient moral courage to
confess, and if she felt happier in the knowledge
that her wrong-doing would never become public,
she, Duane, would help keep the secret.
</p>

<p>
The next day had been passed in the visit
to the vicar's house, and Duane had heard
nothing of the scene in the sports field, and the
feeling against Kitty that had arisen.
</p>

<p>
On her return she had hurried straight from
an interview with Miss Carslake to Paddy's
mock trial, entering late and just in time to
hear the charge against Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"I thought, of course," she explained, "that
it was a deadly earnest affair, and I was so
horror-struck that for once I lost my head
completely.  I don't know what I blurted
out&mdash;something to the effect that I knew for certain
Kitty had not done it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In such a manner as to convince everyone
that you were the conscience-stricken culprit
yourself," finished off Miss St. Leger.  "That
was it, was it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted Duane.  "Afterwards I
knew I had made an ass of myself.  Still, in a
way I was glad, for if the girls had gone on
believing Kitty guilty, it would have put me in
an awful hole, knowing all the time that she
wasn't.  So I consoled myself with the
reflection that it was all for the best."
</p>

<p>
"And were content to shield someone else
at your own expense," said Miss St. Leger
bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"Easiest way," returned Duane with a shrug.
"I'm in the habit of choosing it."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes, perhaps," said Miss St. Leger
cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"Then what did you mean by saying you
were sorry you had wronged me?" asked Kitty
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was merely referring to my wrongly
believing that you were the culprit, the day
before."
</p>

<p>
"And, of course, everybody took it in rather
a different way."
</p>

<p>
"There isn't much more to be told," Duane
continued.  "I must admit it bothered me
sometimes last term when I saw that Erica still
worried over the affair, but I thought she'd get
over it in time.  But she didn't, and what
happened yesterday was the result."
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I gather from this note that it was the
hockey match that decided her."  She glanced
again at the note in her hand, and read it out:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR BERTHA,
</p>

<p>
"I can't stand it any longer,
having people think Duane did it and knowing
all the time it was me.  But I'm not brave
enough to confess to everyone, and so I'm
going to run away home this afternoon.  I'm
going to try and slip away from the others
and get a train at Frattenton.  Gracie Morris
whose home is at Frattenton told me the
way.  I am sorry.  I hate myself for being
such a coward.  But after yesterday afternoon
I felt I just couldn't go on being such
a little pig, though Duane says it's all right
and I mustn't worry my head about her.
Please will you tell them all about everything
after I have gone.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your loving sister,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ERICA."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a short silence.  Then Duane
said slowly:
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad she tried to own up at last.  You
know, I think she would have done so long ago
if it hadn't been for Bertha.  She's got heaps of
physical courage."
</p>

<p>
There was a very kind look in the Principal's
eyes as she turned towards Duane, and laying
her hand on the girl's shoulder, said gently:
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  But I don't think it was altogether
by herself that she decided to own up.
I think someone helped her, if unconsciously."
</p>

<p>
Duane looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, Miss St. Leger?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I think in the end it was your influence
and not Bertha's, that proved the stronger."
</p>

<p>
"I should jolly well think so," added Kitty
emphatically.
</p>

<p>
Duane flushed and looked uncomfortable.
She had told her story with brief simplicity,
plainly and unvarnishedly&mdash;not as it has been
related here.  But her two listeners, knowing
the dramatis personæ so well, had imagined
clearly and vividly all the details and side issues
that Duane had mentioned so baldly.  The girl
had, to a great extent, dropped her flippant,
blasé manner to tell the story.  Now, for a
moment she succeeded in throwing off the
reserve in which she had been trained to hide
her emotions, as she had done before Kitty in
the hut last night.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;Miss St. Leger, perhaps I made an
awful mess of things," she said in a low voice.
"When you talked to me that day you asked
me to&mdash;to take on the head prefectship, and I
promised you I would do my best for the house.
I honestly meant it.  I&mdash;it made me feel a bit
sore sometimes, when I could see quite plainly
I wasn't succeeding, and how the girls disliked
me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," interrupted Miss St. Leger.
"But you remember that I told you, knowing
well enough your task was a difficult one, that
if the juniors were insulting or refused to
acknowledge your authority in any way, or if you
found yourself in difficulties, you were to come
to me and I would settle things for you.  As
you never came, perhaps I hardly realized how
badly things were going sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Kitty broke in, with a chuckle, "Duane
wouldn't ask for help from a soul.  I know her
and her pig-headed pride by now.  If she were
dying she'd never admit herself beaten."
</p>

<p>
"But I did," said Duane, smiling.  "The
Richoter complicated things a bit, and, frankly,
I didn't want to come to you about it, Miss
St. Leger&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," interrupted the Principal.  "As I
said before, you were so busy shielding that
child at your own expense that you didn't want
me to smell a rat.  For I shouldn't and didn't
believe it of you, you know.  You have been
long enough in the school for me to know you,
and what you are and are not capable of doing,
pretty well by now.  However, I believe you
had a partiality for the child and that prejudiced
you."
</p>

<p>
"But one couldn't help being sorry for her,
Miss St. Leger.  It seemed so absurd to hold
her responsible.  She's such a tender-hearted,
timid little thing really.  She wouldn't hurt a
fly if she could help it."
</p>

<p>
"But I could be trusted to see that too,"
remarked the Principal, somewhat dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Miss St. Leger," replied Duane
quickly and with an eagerness that was almost
passionate.  "Of course, I knew that.  If it had
only rested with you!  But it was the publicity
that would have followed that the child couldn't
have faced, the realization that everyone in the
school knew and somehow despised her.  She
thought all the girls would be simply disgusted with
her.  I couldn't make her believe anything else."
</p>

<p>
"The truth is," said Miss St. Leger, "that
you are much too soft-hearted for your job."
</p>

<p>
"I soft-hearted!" Duane exclaimed indignantly.
"Whatever next!  But anyway," with
a mischievous gleam in her grey eyes, "I did
realize my limitations, Miss St. Leger.  I was
reduced to sending in my resignation at one
time, and you know you refused to accept it."
</p>

<p>
"We were a lot of idiots," Kitty interposed
with much vigour.  "I was a new girl, it is
true, but the others ought to have known you
were far and away above doing a petty, spiteful
thing like that."  Needless to say, Kitty was
referring to the Richoter trouble.
</p>

<p>
Miss St. Leger rose.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not going to keep you here any
longer.  The girls will be dying to see you
again and hear about your adventures.  Besides,
Nurse is going to pack you off to bed early.
Duane, I think Miss Carslake is anxious to see
you for a few minutes, so you had better go
there first and then come along to the hall."
</p>

<p>
As Duane disappeared the Principal turned
to Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"You can come along with me, Kitty.  I
gave orders for the girls to assemble in hall
after tea.  We shall find them there now."
</p>

<p>
Kitty understood without being told that she
meant to make a public announcement
concerning the Richoter examination.
</p>

<p>
When they arrived they found the girls
waiting.  The Principal motioned Kitty to
follow her upon the dais, turned to the sea of
expectant, upturned faces, and addressed them
briefly.
</p>

<p>
"I want a misunderstanding cleared up this
evening, girls, a misunderstanding that has been
amongst us too long.  You have for a long
time been treating one amongst you with grave
injustice.  I am, of course, referring to Duane.
May I state most emphatically that the two
girls upon whom suspicion appeared to rest for
attempting to spoil Constance's chances in the
Richoter examination are both quite innocent.
We have just discovered the whole truth of the
matter."
</p>

<p>
There was a stir among the crowd of girls,
a quick intake of breath.  They had naturally
guessed that there was something more than
met the eye in this last mysterious affair in
which, it was whispered, Bertha's little sister
Erica had tried to run away from school, and
Duane and Kitty had gone after her.  Now, at
last, they were going to know everything.
</p>

<p>
The Principal's face had been softened by a
smile.  "You'll be rather surprised to hear that
I'm not going into any long explanations myself.
I'm going to leave Kitty, here, to do that.
She's an authority on the subject, having had
first hand information, and I fancy she'll plead
Duane's cause better than I could.  I'll give
you till prep time, girls, and when prep bell rings
the prefects will see you all go quietly to your
classrooms as usual.  Is that understood?"
</p>

<p>
There was a prompt and eager chorus of
"Yes, Miss St. Leger," and the Principal took
her departure, still with that half-smile about
her lips.
</p>

<p>
Kitty found her task strangely congenial, and
though according to her own statements she
believed in deeds and not words, on this occasion
she found it surprisingly easy to be fluent.
Perhaps the breathless interest with which she was
listened to, broken only by eager questions from
one or other of the girls, spurred her on.  Not
until every smallest detail was described to them
were her hearers satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what," announced Paddy loudly,
when Kitty had finally come to a full stop.
"There's no getting away from the fact, you
girls, that we've treated Cato pretty shabbily."
</p>

<p>
Paddy's remark was unnecessarily obvious.
The girls, big and little, looked at each other
rather shamefacedly, and were all of the same
opinion.  Peggy was expressing herself forcibly
to her followers:
</p>

<p>
"Come to think of it, we are rather a lot of
chumps, you kids.  As if a girl who played the
game like Duane did in that match against the
school, could do a mean trick like that!"
</p>

<p>
Then Salome had sprung upon the dais and
was speaking:
</p>

<p>
"There's just another thing, girls.  As it
happens, far more fuss has been made over
the affair that it&mdash;it deserves.  We must
remember that Erica Salter is little more than
a child, and did not realize fully what she was
doing.  I am sure, by Kitty's account, she
has suffered enough, and we mustn't be hard
on her.  The best thing to do is to put the
whole affair away and forget it as quickly as
we can."  She paused a moment, then had one
of the "nice" ideas that were part of the secret
of Salome's well-deserved popularity, and
concluded with a smile, "We won't be nasty to
little Erica, if it's only out of regard for all
the trouble Duane's taken to try and keep
her from being unhappy and miserable."
</p>

<p>
Everybody signified their assent by stamping
on the floor, and Vanda, as a head prefect,
also thought it the proper thing to add her
opinion:
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to make it up a bit to
Duane for treating her so shabbily, shan't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" came an enthusiastic chorus
from everybody.
</p>

<p>
Then Kitty had an inspiration.
</p>

<p>
"I say, girls, I've got a brain-wave.  Duane'll
be coming along in a minute, you know, when
Miss Carslake's finished with her.  Isn't there
a match against St. Magdalene's to-morrow?"
and Kitty proceeded to impart her "brain-wave"
to her interested audience.
</p>

<p>
When Duane, a little later, strolled into the
hall with leisurely step and tranquil mien, and
found the whole school assembled there and
regarding her with ludicrously solemn,
immovable faces, a little of her coolness deserted
her.  She eyed them uneasily for a moment.
Why this remarkable silence?  Why did they
all stare at her so hard?
</p>

<p>
Then Salome called from the dais at the
top end of the room:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is it you, Duane?  Just the person
we want.  Come along up here.  We have a
little business transaction to carry out."
</p>

<p>
Duane recovered her customary calm, and,
mounting the dais, bowed exaggeratedly to
Salome.
</p>

<p>
"Well met by gaslight, proud Titania."
</p>

<p>
Somebody giggled, then subsided with a
little squeak.
</p>

<p>
Salome looked at Duane.  "The school
sports club have great pleasure in presenting
you with this," she said gravely and very
distinctly.  "They have also put your name
down in the eleven for the match against
St. Mary Magdalene's to-morrow, and hope you
will play.  They also wish me to say," and
there was a slight tremor in her voice, "that
they are quite convinced that you have always
worn it with honour in the past, and they know
you will continue to do so in the future."
</p>

<p>
The tension relaxed with a tumultuous burst
of applause.  Duane, her old hockey colour
tightly clutched in the hand that hung at her
side, bit her lip hard to control its trembling.
But only for the moment.  With the loud,
delighted yells of "Speech, Speech!" from
everybody sounding on all sides, she turned
and faced them, speaking in the old familiar
drawl as soon as the noise had died down.
</p>

<p>
"I see by your anxiety to hear me that
you are well aware I speak with authority and
not as the scribes"&mdash;loud cheers&mdash;"or
perhaps I should say, the juniors&mdash;but on this
occasion I'm not going to say much.  I will
convince the hockey club of my earnestness
by the number of goals I shall score on its
behalf to-morrow.  When they see shots falling
about the St. Mary's goalkeeper like&mdash;like leaves
in autumn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Everybody, amid laughter, realized that it
was apparently the same old Cato talking and
not some unfamiliar heroine of fiction.  The
rest of the speech was never heard, for someone
struck up "For she's a jolly good fellow,"
and they continued it till prep bell put an end
to the din.
</p>

<p>
Smiles and kindly words were seen everywhere
in Carslake's that evening.  Kitty and
Duane were actually going in to supper
arm-in-arm; France and Margaret beamed with
delight at everybody.  The girls in Dormitory
A were squabbling as to who should fetch their
head prefect's hot water, but Duane settled
the matter by asking Erica if she wouldn't
mind doing it, and as Erica took the jug, a
happier look on her face than there had been
for many a week, no one said an ungenerous
word or gave her an unkind look.
</p>

<p>
When Miss Carslake came round to switch
off the lights there was a very hearty "Good
night" in response to hers, and the house
mistress went on her way happily conscious
that one could say of her house at last, "All's
well."
